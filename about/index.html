<h2>About <span id="updated">(Updated 2024-3-13)</span></h2>
  
<p>My name is R. Floyd Lindquist. I am an independent scholar, researcher, and consultant who puts personal responsibility over self-pity, and spiritual duty over self-indulgence. I currently live in the midwestern United States.</p>
  
<p>Several <a href="/files/pdf/cv.pdf">pieces of paper</a> prove that I have read various books, attended various lectures, and passed various tests - some clinical, others theoretical.

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<p>The following questions are not necessary frequent to me, personally (though some are); yet, I address them below (in no particular order) because either or both (a) they are questions likely to come up, and (b) they are questions frequently asked to - and about - pretty much anyone who is anything less than hysterically hostile toward real conservatives and real Christians, good husbands and good dads, and so forth.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me with a question if you are a conservative Christian and either or both a husband and dad. The question can be about this FAQ, how I can or cannot help, or otherwise.</p>

                <p>Q1. Why only conservatives?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq_answer">
                <p>A1. Because of conservatives' inherent supremacy - and the systematic attacks against that supremacy. (Note: conservatism is, of course, (a) on a spectrum, and (b) necessary but <em>not sufficient</em>.).</p>

            <div class="faq_answer">
                <p>
                    A2. The simplest reason is that the pandemic of hysterical, abusive, and unlawful responses to the anti-science covid fraud, the tyrannical medical-martial-law, and the death-shot bio-weapon showed that only Christians can be trusted. Still, obviously not all Christians can be trusted. (For example, Trump is a degenerate traitor whose lies and hubris contributed hugely to the depth and breadth of the covid scam; yet, plenty Christians still trust him. Anyone who still trusts Trump is either a fool or a tool - and, in any case, not to be trusted.).

            </div>
            <div class="faq_answer">
                <p>
                    A3. Because of husbands and dads' paramount importance - and the systematic attacks against that importance. Also, because men asserting authority over other men's wives and children is destroying our world. Our world is now infested with countless men who claim authority and control over other men's women and children; however, a good man asserts authority and control only over his own wife and children. So, no good man asserts the authority to teach or correct another man's wife and children, except under the rare circumstance where the husband or dad gives limited authority to another man in order to manage an emergency. (Policemen are a simple and obvious example.) Otherwise, a good man will teach and correct only another man, then expect that other man to pass along all, some, or none of that teaching and correction to his own family, as he sees fits.

                <p>
                    A5. A woman is someone who, to survive and thrive, requires about 400% more essential bodyfat that a man needs. Otherwise, her bones die and her organs shut down.

            <div class="faq_answer">
                <p>
                    A7. Generally, yes - but not when "choice" is a euphemism for murdering a child: I reject the degenerate satanic conspiracy of government patriarchs gifting deadbeat moms the privilege to murder men's children. Here are two more important disclosures: (1) women voting is degenerate and evil; more specifically, degenerate evil arises when government patriarchs gift draft-exempt women the privilege to vote for government patriarchs' authority to force men into war; (2) women pretending authority over men is degenerate and evil; more specifically, anywhere where men let women pretend any authority of any man: there you will find only hysterical, chaotic, and miserable men, women, and children. (And plenty of the women will either die or become brain-damaged from the vaginal cotton-cramming that the gender-equality fraud necessitates.).

            <div class="faq_answer">
                <p>
                    A8. In cases of emergency, I am willing to directly help almost anyone (except bad people, such as child-castrators and child-killers). However, husbands and dads have the primacy authority and responsibility to help a given woman or child. So, I am willing to help anyone - but, for non-husbands and non-dads, that help happen indirectly, trhough their husband or dad.

                    A12. No, because the internet and phones are generally compromised methods of communication. However, I do decouple (a) the client's personally identifiable information (PII), from (b) the help that a given client gets. So, my own record-keeping does not create any legitimate way for any abusive person or entity to prove why I communicated with a given client.

            <div class="faq_answer">
                <p>
                    A13. No, because the internet and phones are generally compromised methods of communication. However, I do decouple all personally identifiable information (PII) from a given client's help - generally needing PII only for billing, if any. Moreover, if you check out my <a href="https://floydfacts.github.io/files/lindquist_r_floyd--degrees_certs_titles--updated--2024-3-13.pdf">pieces of paper</a>, then you will notice that I am very protective of even the institutions with whom I deal or have dealt: that I disclose only the identities of only those main-stream entities that could easily survive any guilt-by-association in dealing with me, but that I do not disclose even the degree-granting entities from which I earned my biggest pieces of papers. I have no interest in bringing them any sociopolitical heat by their association with me - and much less do I want to harm the social well-being of those whom I help. Thus, I work under strict confidentiality for a client, at least - and often under the client's general anonymity, except as necessary to accurately report earnings..

                    A14. I am willing to give all the direct help that I can to only limited categories of women and children: my own wife; my sons; my unmarried daughters; and emergency help for the following categories of women, as long as they are generally worthy of help: widows, marriage-minded women, and (in very limited circumstances) married women. Any other person is also welcomed to my help - indirectly, through their husband or dad.
