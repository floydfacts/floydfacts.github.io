<h2>About <span id="updated">(Updated 2024-3-13)</span></h2>
  
<p>My name is R. Floyd Lindquist. I was born on January 12, 1979, in Provo, Utah, and grew up mostly in San Diego, California. I am an independent scholar, researcher, and consultant, currently living in the midwestern United States.</p>

<p>My help focuses on sharing the evidence-based value of honesty, patience, candor, humility, and courage. Two goals animate the help: (1) developing personal strength, and (2) reaffirming duty to self, family, community, and country. Any focus on the wider world comes only <em>after</em>, and <em>subordinate to</em>, those more immediate duties. The foundation of this help and these goals is reverence, above all, to the Laws of Nature and Natureâ€™s God (LONANG).</p>

<p>Several <a href="/files/pdf/cv.pdf">pieces of paper</a> prove that I have read various books, attended various lectures, and passed various tests - some clinical, others theoretical.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<p>The following questions are not necessarily frequent to me, personally (though some are); yet, I address them below (in no particular order) because either or both (a) they are questions likely to come up, and (b) they are questions frequently asked to - and about - pretty much anyone who is anything less than hysterically hostile toward real conservatives and real Christians, good husbands and good dads, and so forth.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me with a question if you are a conservative Christian and either or both a husband and dad. The question can be about this FAQ, how I can or cannot help, or otherwise.</p>

<div id="faq">

            <h3 class="accordion">Q1. Why only conservatives?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>A1. Because of conservatives' inherent supremacy - and the systematic attacks against that supremacy. (Note: conservatism is, of course, (a) on a spectrum, and (b) necessary but <em>not sufficient</em>.).</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q2. Why only Christians?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A2. The simplest reason is that the pandemic of hysterical, abusive, and unlawful responses to the anti-science covid fraud, the tyrannical medical-martial-law, and the death-shot bio-weapon showed that only Christians can be trusted. Still, obviously not all Christians can be trusted. (For example, Trump is a degenerate traitor whose lies and hubris contributed hugely to the depth and breadth of the covid scam; yet, plenty Christians still trust him. Anyone who still trusts Trump is either a fool or a tool - and, in any case, not to be trusted.). 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q3. Why only husbands and dads?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A3. Because of husbands and dads' paramount importance - and the systematic attacks against that importance. Also, because men asserting authority over other men's wives and children is destroying our world. Our world is now infested with countless men who claim authority and control over other men's women and children; however, a good man asserts authority and control only over his own wife and children. So, no good man asserts the authority to teach or correct another man's wife and children, except under the rare circumstance where the husband or dad gives limited authority to another man in order to manage an emergency. (Policemen are a simple and obvious example.) Otherwise, a good man will teach and correct only another man, then expect that other man to pass along all, some, or none of that teaching and correction to his own family, as he sees fits.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q4. Will you help me about my husband or dad?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A4. No. But I will help your husband or dad about you if they want. Feel free to pass along my email to them. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q5. What is a woman?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A5. A woman is someone who, to survive and thrive, requires about 400% more essential bodyfat that a man needs. Otherwise, her bones and organs die. Feel free to ask for evidence-based research about that.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q6. What do you think about gender equality?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A6. I rejct lies, including the misogynistic, dangerous - and often deadly - fraud of <em>gender equality</em>. Also, the term is <em>sex</em>, not <em>gender</em>. Gender is generally a degenerate term created by perverts and child-rapists, especially Johns Hopkins University's evil researchers: John Money. Feel free to ask about my academic research on that.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q7. Do you support a woman's right to choose?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A7. Generally, yes - but not when "choice" is a euphemism for murdering a child: I reject the degenerate satanic conspiracy of government patriarchs gifting deadbeat moms the privilege to murder men's children. Here are two more important disclosures: (1) women voting is degenerate and evil; more specifically, degenerate evil arises when government patriarchs gift draft-exempt women the privilege to vote for government patriarchs' authority to force men into war; (2) women pretending authority over men is degenerate and evil; more specifically, anywhere where men let women pretend any authority over any man: there you will find only hysterical, chaotic, and miserable men, women, and children. (And plenty of the women will either die or become brain-damaged from the vaginal cotton-cramming that the gender-equality fraud necessitates. Feel free to ask for evidence-based research about that.)
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q8. What if someone who is not a husband or dad asks for your help?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A8. In cases of emergency, I am willing to directly help almost anyone (except bad people, such as child-castrators and child-killers). However, husbands and dads have the prime authority and responsibility to help a given woman or child. So, I am willing to help anyone, but for non-husbands and non-dads, that help will happen indirectly, through their husband or dad. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q9. Do you have any data or other evidence to support your claim of X?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A9. Definitely. And I freely offer that evidence to any paying customer (who pays with either their money or time). 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q10. Are you a [insert hysterical newspeak slur]?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A10. No. 
                </p>

            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q11. Do you hate [insert political-landmine mascot]?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A11. No. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q12. Can you guarantee my privacy if I get help from you?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A12. No, because the internet and phones are generally compromised methods of communication. However, I do decouple (a) the client's personally identifiable information (PII), from (b) the help that a given client gets. So, my own record-keeping does not create any legitimate way for any abusive person or entity to prove why I communicated with a given client.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q13. Can you guarantee the protection of my reputation if I get help from you?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A13. No, because the internet and phones are generally compromised methods of communication. However, I do decouple all personally identifiable information (PII) from a given client's help - generally needing PII only for billing, if any. Moreover, if you check out my <a href="https://floydfacts.github.io/files/lindquist_r_floyd--degrees_certs_titles--updated--2024-3-13.pdf">pieces of paper</a>, then you will notice that I am very protective of even the institutions with whom I deal or have dealt: that I disclose only the identities of only those main-stream entities that could easily survive any guilt-by-association in dealing with me, but that I do not disclose even the degree-granting entities from which I earned my biggest pieces of papers. I have no interest in bringing them any sociopolitical heat by their association with me - and much less do I want to harm the social well-being of those whom I help. Thus, I work under at least strict confidentiality for a client - and often under the client's general anonymity.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q14. So, you are unwilling to help any women and children?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A14. I am willing to give all the direct help that I can to only limited categories of women and children: my own wife; my sons; my unmarried daughters; and emergency help for the following categories of women, as long as they are generally worthy of help: widows, marriage-minded women, and (in very limited circumstances) married women. Everyone else is also welcomed to my help - indirectly, through their husband or dad. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q15. So, you are unwilling to help men who are either or both unmarried or childless?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A15. Generally, I am willing to give extremely limited emergency help to unmarried or childless men who are otherwise worthy of help. This excludes degenerate cowardly self-indulgent men who simply refuse to marry. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q16. Will you help a divorced dad?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A16. Possibly - but the reasons for the divorce hugely matter. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q17. Will you help a childless widower?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A17. Yes - as long as he is generally worthy of help (not a sexual degenerate and so forth). 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q18. Do you consider a gay married man (a man indulging in rectum-centric mockery of marriage) to be a husband for the purpose of your help?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A18. No. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q19. Do you consider a "transman" (a castrated and mangled woman) to be a husband or dad for the purpose of your help?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A19. No. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q20. Why do you use terms that are clearly hate-speech?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A20. Truth is hate-speech only to degenerate liars who hate the truth. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q21. Aren't you worried that having standards that devil-worshipers hate will limit your reach/acceptance/etc?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A21. No. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q22. Aren't you worried that government will force you to help "transmen" (castrated and mangled women) or "gay men" (degenerate sexists who (a) hate women, and (b) define themselves and their lives by that degeneracy, hatred, and obsession with other men's rectums)?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A22. No. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion">Q23. Do you believe that men and women have a sacrosanct right - constitutional or otherwise - to lie about their sex through either or both fashion and surgical mutilation?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A23. No. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="accordion">Q24. What is your opinion about modern psychiatry and, more generally, the mental health professions?</h3>
<div class="panel">
            <p>
                    A24.
                </p>
                    <h4>Psychiatry: Miserable, Unpersuasive Control-freaks</h4>

<p>*The following analysis criticizes psychiatry specifically. Still, the critcism applies to every clinician in every branch and system of so-called mental health, except those clinicians whose expertise is completely voluntary for the allegedly helped person.</p>

<h5>Psychiatry is Totally Unpersuasive</h5>

	<p>The singular shared feature of all control-freaks is that they are not persuasvie. After all, no persuasive person ever needs to be a control-freak: they need only persuade. So, control-freaks are, almost by definition, not persuasive. Control-freaks may be tedious or boring, too timid or too brash - but in any case, simply not persuasive. Psychiatry is not science at all. Yet, if psychiatry were described as a science, then it would be the science of being a pathetic control-freak: of being a stunningly unimpressive cog among legions of unpersuasive weirdos whose specialization has zero objective value, that is, whose entire existence requires massive pretending, indeed compulsion. Manifestly, the compulsion underlying every control-freak of psychiatry is a sociological litigiousness where a given party seeks to leverage psychiatry's control-freaks against the party's adversary. Hence, the well-earned and well-deserved epidemic of misery and self-murder among the pathetic control-freaks psychiatry. Hence, also, the complete lack of objective standards for the fraudulent profession of psychiatry.</p>

<h5>Psychiatry is Totally Subjective</h5>

<p>For more than a century, psychiatry has desperately tried -- at totally failed -- to present itself as medicine. More basically, the pathetic control-freaks of psychiatry have tried and failed for more than a century to present themselves as minimally objective, much less objectively beneficial, as medicine requires. Instead, every generation of pathetic control-freak psychiatrists waste its life playing along with the boring, redundant, and unscientific fraud that psychiatry is finally on the precipice of proving its objectivity. Yet, every psychiatrist dies as he lived: a fraud and a quack, with zero objectivity. Hence, again, the unsurprising and well-deserved epidemic of self-murder among the pathetic control-freaks of psychiatry. Meanwhile, history tells of countless psychiatrists who decide against the physical death of self-murder, and against the spiritual death of continuing in psychiatry - and, instead, choose to reject and rebel against the lowly degeneracy of psychiatry. Thomas Szasz, for all his bad, is a good example. Yet, if I were to waste a hundred or so minutes, then I could easily present, from the last hundred months (probably even days), one hundred idiots of psychiatry publishing in "peer" reviewed journals about how some test or tactic "may be" the Rosetta Stone that finally unlocks psychiatry's objectivity. It is always wrong - and they are always lying: either lying about what they know, or else lying about what they do not know.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="accordion">Q25. Can I try my pathetic political mind-games on you?</h3>
<div class="panel">
                <p>
                    A25. Sure. 
                </p>
