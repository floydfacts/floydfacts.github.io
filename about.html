<p>My name is R. Floyd Lindquist. I am an independent scholar and researcher, currently in midwestern United States. Several <a href="paper.html">pieces of papers</a> prove that I have read various books, attended various lectures, and passed various tests - some clinical, some theoretical. The <a href="about">about</a> page has more. <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> me if you would like.</p>
