<h2>About <span id="updated">(Updated 2024-3-13)</span></h2>
  
<p>My name is R. Floyd Lindquist. I am an independent scholar and researcher, currently in midwestern United States.</p>
  
<p>Several <a href="files/lindquist_r_floyd--degrees_certs_titles--updated--2024-3-13.pdf">pieces of paper</a> prove that I have read various books, attended various lectures, and passed various tests - some clinical, others theoretical.

<p>Currently, the best way to contact me is by email: floydfacts[at]yahoo[dot]com</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>Feel free to contact me with a question if you are a conservative Christian and either or both a husband and dad. The question can be about this FAQ, how I can or cannot help, or otherwise.</p>
<p>The following questions are not necessary frequent to me personally (though some are); yet, I address them below (in no particular order) because either or both (a) they are questions likely to come up, and (b) they are questions frequently asked to and about pretty much anyone who is anything less than hysterically hostile toward real conservatives and real Christians, good husbands and good dads, and so forth.</p>
  
<ol id="faq">
<li><strong>Why only conservatives?</strong> Because of conservatives' inherent supremacy - and the systematic attacks against that supremacy. (Note: conservatism is, of course, (a) on a spectrum, and (b) necessary <em>but not</em> sufficient.)</li>
<li><strong>Why only Christians?</strong> The simplest reason is that the pandemic of hysterical responses to the anti-science covid fraud, the tyrannical medical-martial-law, and the death-shot bio-weapon showed that only Christians - and not all of them - can be trusted. (For example, Trump is a degenerate traitor whose lies and hubris contributed hugely to the efficacy of the covid scam; yet, plenty Christians still trust him. Anyone who still trusts Trump is either a fool or a tool - and, in any case, not to be trusted.)</li>
<li><strong>Why only husbands and dads?</strong> Because of fathers and dads' paramount importance - and the systematic attacks against that importance.</li>
<li><strong>What is a woman?</strong> A woman is someone who, to survive and thrive, requires about %400 more essential bodyfat that a man needs. Otherwise, her bones die and her organs shut down.</li>
<li><strong>What do you think about gender equality?</strong> I rejct lies, including the misogynistic, dangerous - and often deadly - fraud of <em>gender equality</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Do you support a woman's right to choose?</strong> Generally, yes - but not when the choice is about murdering a child: I reject the degenerate satanic conspiracy of government patriarchs gifting deadbeat moms the privilege to murder men's children. Here are two more important disclosures: (1) women voting is degenerate and evil; more specifically, degenerate evil arises when government patriarchs gift draft-exempt women the privilege to vote for government patriarchs' authority to force men into war; (2) women pretending authority over men is degenerate and evil; more specifically, anywhere where men let women pretend any authority of any man: there you will find only hysterical, chaotic, and miserable men, women, and children. (And plenty of the women will either die or become brain-damaged from the vaginal cotton-cramming that the gender-equality fraud necessitates.)</li>
<li><strong>What if someone who is not a husband or dad asks for your help?</strong> In cases of emergency, I am willing to directly help almost anyone (except bad people, such as child-castrators and child-killers). However, husbands and dads have the primacy authority and responsibility to help a given woman or child. So, I am willing to help anyone - but, for non-husbands and non-dads, that help happen indirectly, trhough their husband or dad.</li>
<li><strong>Do you have any data or other evidence to support your claim of X?</strong> Definitely. And I freely offer that evidence to any paying customer (who pays with either their money or time).</li>
<li><strong>Are you a [insert hysterical newspeak slur]?</strong> No.</li>
<li><strong>Do you hate [insert political-landmine mascot]?</strong> No.</li>
<li><strong>Can you guarantee my privacy if I get help from you?</strong> No, because the internet and phones are generally compromised methods of communication. However, I do decouple all personally identifiable information (PII) from a given client's help - generally needing PII only for billing, if any.</li>
<li><strong>Can you guarantee the protection of my reputation if I get help from you?</strong> No, because the internet and phones are generally compromised methods of communication. However, I do decouple all personally identifiable information (PII) from a given client's help - generally needing PII only for billing, if any. Moreover, if you check out my <a href="https://floydfacts.github.io/files/lindquist_r_floyd--degrees_certs_titles--updated--2024-3-13.pdf">pieces of paper</a>, then you will notice that I am very protective of even the institutions with whom I deal or have dealt: that I disclose only the identities of only those main-stream entities that could easily survive any guilt-by-association in dealing with me, but that I do not disclose even the degree-granting entities from which I earned my biggest pieces of papers. I have no interest in bringing them any sociopolitical heat by their association with me - and much less do I want to harm the social well-being of those whom I help. Thus, I work under strict confidentiality for a client, at least - and often under the client's general anonymity, except as necessary to accurately report earnings.</li>
<li><strong>So, you are unwilling to help any women and children?</strong> I am willing to give all the direct help that I can to only limited categories of women and children: my own wife; my sons; my unmarried daughters; and emergency help for the following categories of women, as long as they are generally worthy of help: widows, marriage-minded women, and (in very limited circumstances) married women. Any other person is also welcomed to my help - <em>indirectly</em>, through their husband or dad.</li>
<li><strong>So, you are unwilling to help men who are either or both unmarried or childless?</strong> Generally, I am willing to give extremely limited emergency help to unmarried or childless men who are otherwise worthy of help. This excludes degenerate cowardly self-indulgent men who simply refuse to marry.</li>
<li><strong>Will you help a divorced dad?</strong> Generally, yes - but the reasons for the divorce hugely matter.</li>
<li><strong>Will you help a childless widower?</strong> Generally, yes - as long as he is otherwise worthy of help.</li>
<li><strong>Do you consider a man indulging in rectum-centric mockery of marriage to be a husband for the purpose of your help?</strong> No.</li>
<li><strong>Do you consider a castrated and mangled woman, masquerading as a "transman," to be a husband or dad for the purpose of your help?</strong> No.</li>
<li><strong>Why do you use terms that are clearly hate-speech?</strong> Truth is only hate-speech to those who hate the truth.</li>
<li><strong>Aren't you worried that having standards that devil-worshipers hate will limit your reach/acceptance/etc?</strong> No.</li>
<li><strong>Aren't you worried that government will force you to help castrated and mangled women masquerading as "transmen," or filthy degenerate men pretending to be married to a man, who define themselves and their lives by their obsession with other men's excretory systems?</strong> No.</li>
<li><strong>Can I try my pathetic political mind-games on you?</strong> Sure.</li>
