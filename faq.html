<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>These questions are not necessary frequent to me personally (though some are); yet, I address them because they are questions frequently asked to and about pretty much anyone who is anything less than hysterically hostile toward husbands, dads, real conservatives, and so forth.</p>
  
<ul>
<li><strong>Why only fathers and dads?</strong> Because of fathers and dads' paramount importance - and the systematic attacks against that importance.</li>
<li><strong>Why only conservatives?</strong> Because of conservatives' inherent supremacy - and the systematic attacks against that supremacy. (Note: conservatism is, of course, (a) on a spectrum, and (b) necessary <em>but not</em> sufficient.)</li>
<li><strong>Do you have any data or other evidence to support your claim of X?</strong> Definitely. And I freely offer that evidence to any paying customer (who pays with either their money or time).</li>
<li><strong>Are you a [insert hysterical newspeak slur]?</strong> No.</li>
<li><strong>Do you hate [insert political-landmine mascot]?</strong> No.</li>
</ul>
