<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>These questions are not necessary frequent to me personally (though some are); yet, I address them because they are questions frequently asked to and about pretty much anyone who is anything less than hysterically hostile toward husbands, dads, real conservatives, and so forth.</p>
  
<ul>
<li>Why only fathers and dads?</li>
<li>Why only conservatives? (gradations; necessary but not sufficient)</li>
<li>Are you a [insert hysterical newspeak slur]? (no)</li>
<li>Are you aware that [insert limp leftist or rightist] disagrees with your conclusions about X? That depends on the particular X. However, I am generally plenty aware of alternative opinions to my own conclusions. Indeed, rejection of those bad opinions often inform and motivate my various conclusions.</li>
</ul>
