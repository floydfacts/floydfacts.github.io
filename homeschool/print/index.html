<p>The first and best government contact for homeschooling is generally the superintendent's office for your kid's district. If you are unsure about how to contact that office, feel free to call your local school. Your local school can tell you how to contact the superintendent. The local school might be able to help with some questions; but, the school will need to refer you to the superintendent's office for some questions.</p>

<!-- TIP 1 ##########################################  -->

<h3 class="collapsible">Tip 1. Government Involvement in Homeschooling</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>In the U.S., thus in Minnesota, homeschooling still involves the government. As citizens of the United States and Minnesota, we husbands and fathers agree to abide by the laws written by the men of the U.S. and Minnesota government. Regarding education, the U.S. federal government sets only broad laws. To receive federal education funding, a state must follow federal education laws. For more on that dynamic, read the Congressional Research Service's (CRS) <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10551">Summary of Federal Education Laws Administered by the U.S. Department of Education (2022 update)</a>. (The U.S. Congress directs the CRS, which is a nonpartisan entity tasked with conducting research to help Congress.) Again, the extent of those federal laws is to offer federal money to states for following certain basic laws of the U.S. Department of Education, which is federal.</p> 
       
<p>Meanwhile, nearly all government involvement in education arises under state law. Thus, as Minnesota fathers and husbands, we are concerned with the <em>Minnesota Education Code</em>, which Minnesota law defines as chapters 120A to 129C of the Minnesota statutes. Minn. Stat. 120A.01 ("Chapters 120A to 129C may be cited as the Education Code.").</p> 
       
<p>Beyond that, each local school district must follow its state's laws. A district may set its own local policies, as long as the local policies do not conflict with state law about education or civil rights. (Nor may the local policies conflict with federal laws, for example federal civil rights laws.)</p>
       
<p>Learn more about the Minnesota Education Code below, at Links &gt; Minnesota Education Laws for Homeschool &gt; Minnesota Education Code &gt; 120A.22 (Compulsory Instruction). There, you will find a link to a PDF of the Minnesota Education Code. I personally edited the code for clarity and relevance to conservative Christian husbands who are helping their wives to homeschool their children, or who are interested in starting. The PDF also has a link to the full, unedited Minnesota Education Code at the government's website.</p></li>
</div>
       
<!-- TIP 2 ##########################################  -->
<h3 class="collapsible">Tip 2. Yearly Testing of Homeschool Kids</h3>
<div class="content">

<p><em>*For information on getting free test materials from your district, see Tip 3 below. Also, the Minnesota Association of Christian Home Educators (MACHE) has some information about finding national standardized tests. MACHE may be reached with the information below: Links &gt; Minnesota Homeschool Resources &gt; MACHE.</em></p>
       
<p>Yearly Testing: General Rule. When your wife homeschools your kid, Minnesota law will generally require yearly testing of your kid: "a nationally norm-referenced standarized achievement examination." Minn. Stat. ยง 120A.22, subd.11(a).</p>
       
<p>Exceptions. Sub-section (b) of the above law provides exceptions to the general testing rule if your wife, or another who teaches your homeschooled child, meets one of the following three criteria: (1) has a Minnesota teaching license for the subject and grade-level taught; or (2) is directly supervised by a person with a Minnesota teaching license; or (3) instructs in a school accredited by an accrediting agency recognize by section 123B.445.</p>
       
<p>Read the laws cited about by going to PDF below at Links &gt; Minnesota Education Laws for Homeschool &gt; Minnesota Education Code.</p>
</div>
       
<!-- TIP 3 ##########################################  -->
<h3 class="collapsible">Tip 3. Free Textbooks, Tests, and Software</h3>
<div class="content">
       
<p>You local district has a duty under law to honor your request if you ask for certain resources to homeschool your child. For more about that, check the sources below at Links &gt; Minnesota Education Laws for Homeschool &gt; Minnesota Statute 123b (school district aid to nonpublic students) &gt; 123B.42 (Textbooks; Individual Instruction or Cooperative Learning Material; Standard Tests).</p>

<p>Here is an example of the the laws.</p>

<p><strong>123B.42 Textbooks; Individual Instruction or Cooperative Learning Material; Standard Tests.</strong></p>
       
<p><strong>Subdivision 1. District Providing Free Education Materials and Tests for Homeschooled Kids.</strong> The commissioner of education shall promulgate rules under the provisions of chapter 14 requiring that in each school year, based upon formal requests by or on behalf of nonpublic school pupils in a nonpublic school, the local districts or intermediary service areas must purchase or otherwise acquire textbooks, individualized instructional or cooperative learning materials, software or other educational technology, and standardized tests and loan or provide them for use by children enrolled in that nonpublic school. These textbooks, individualized instructional or cooperative learning materials, software or other educational technology, and standardized tests must be loaned or provided free to the children for the school year for which requested. The loan or provision of the textbooks, individualized instructional or cooperative learning materials, and standardized tests shall be subject to rules prescribed by the commissioner of education.</p>
       
<p><strong>Subd. 1a. District Providing Free Electronic and Software parts of Curriculum to Homeschooled Kids.</strong> A school district that provides curriculum to resident students that has both physical and electronic components must make the electronic component accessible to a resident student in a home school in compliance with sections 120A.22 and 120A.24 at the request of the student or the student's parent or guardian, provided that the district does not incur more than an incidental cost as a result of providing access electronically.</p>

</div>
<!-- TIP 6 ##########################################  -->

<h3 class="collapsible">Tip 6. Homeschool Record Keeping</h3>
<div class="content">
  <p>Minnesota will require you and your wife to keep records of the resources and material that you use to teach your kid about the required subjects. The law describes what to keep as a record. See Minn. Stat. ยง 120A.24, subd.2(a). A PDF of that law is below: Links &gt; Minnesota Education Laws for Homeschool &gt; Minnesota Education Code.</p>

  <!-- SECTION: Reasons #######################################  -->

<h2 class="collapsible">Important Reasons to Homeschool</h2>
<div class="content">

<p><em>*Right now, only reason 1 is completed. The others are coming soon.</em></p>

<p>As our society collapses and reorganizes, a conservative Christian father (CCF) must protect his wife and their children from degeneracy and other danger in society. As a key example, a CCF must carefully guide his wife about schooling for their kids. Many good reasons will motivate a conservative Christian father to choose homeschool for his children. Some important reasons follow.</p>

<div class="toc">

<ol>
<li>1. Public Schools Reject a Father's Authority</li>
<li>2. Public School is Often Dangerous</li>
<li>3. Public School Teachers are Often Degenerates</li>
<li>4. Public Schools Often Promote Danger and Degeneracy</li>
<li>5. Every Public School Lies About Vaccines</li>
<li>6. Every Public School Lied About Covid</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3 class="collapsible">1. Public Schools Reject a Father's Authority</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>Parents, especially fathers - not the state - have ultimate authority over their children. Yet many minions' of government-run public schools completely and openly reject the authority of fathers. Disregard for a father's (and mother's) authority obviously speaks for itself and is already the stuff of legends. Still, two examples follow - grabbed at random today, from among the hundreds of examples that could be easily given. (To find the examples, I simply searched "parental rights education.") The rejection of fathers' authority by minions of government-run public schools: this will motivate every reasonable father to strongly consider helping his wife to homeschool their children.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Parents' rights . . . [undermine] . . . math, science, and reading" - according to some crazy old culturally Jewish atheist lady with a law degree from Harvard.[1] Many anti-family fools share the crazy old lady's bad opinion. For example, socialist minions of the National Education Association (NEA) denounce, as a "destructive agenda," laws against teaching children the alphabet cult's sexual degeneracy agenda.[2] Elsewhere, the NEA, which is the largest teachers union, openly promotes the sexualized destruction of children - and decries real and imagined "bias and intolerance" against their sexual-degeneracy cult.[3] </li>
<li>"Too much" parental involvement "undermine[s] behavioral development" of children - according to some crazy old lady at Stanford whose smile now looks like a frown, as she echoes a childless University-of-Minnesota-trained psychologist.[4] Elsewhere, evidence shows what the crazy old lady probably means by parents undermining their children's "behavioral development": two years earlier, the crazy old lady reported that high school students are often "unprepared to judge the credibility of information on the internet." As evidence, the crazy old lady cited people disagreeing with her and her political teammates about their climate alarmist myths and other unscientific propaganda.[5]</li>

<h2 class="collapsible">Steps to Start Homeschooling</h2>
<div class="content">
       
<p>Following are some steps for you to help your wife start to start homeschooling in Minnesota. For a more thorough explanation of the process, visit the Minnesota Association of Christian Home Educators (MACH) at <a href="https://mache.org">mache.org</a>, and go to Resources &gt; <a href="https://mache.org/how-to-begin-homeschooling/">How to Begin Homeschooling</a>. MACHE also provides free <a href="https://mache.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Reporting-Forms-8_22.pdf">annual reporting forms</a>, as well as guidance about which form to use and when.</p>

<div class="toc">
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
       <li>Clarify your Motivations</li>
       <li>Clarify your Goals</li>
       <li>Evaluate your wife's desire</li>
       <li>Evaluate your wife's ability</li>
       <li>Keep your kid home; notify the district</li>
       <li>Find curricula</li>
       <li>Find a qualified teacher or teachers</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="collapsible">Step 2. Clarify your goals</h3>
<div class="content">
  <p>Coming up</p>
</div>

<h3 class="collapsible">Step 3. Evaluate your wife's <em>desire</em></h3>
<div class="content">
  <p>As a husband and father, you obviously have authority over your wife, and your role is to guide her. However, be fair - and <em>realistic</em> - about whether your wife really wants to homeschool.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="collapsible">Step 4. Evaluate your wife's <em>ability</em></h3>
<div class="content">
  <p>Again, be realistic. Even if your wife is <em>motiavted</em> to homeschool, still, homeschooling could be beyond her ability and might overwhelm her. Consider allowing her to <em>try</em> homeschooling - and know that you can change back to non-homeschooling if homeschool turns out to be beyond your wife's ability for now. (And obviously consider letting her try again, even soon after failure, if she thinks, and you agree, that she may have improved her ability to homeschool.)</p>
       </div>

<h3 class="collapsible">Step 5. Keep your kid home; notify the district</h3>
<div class="content">
  <p>Homeschooling just means legally keeping your kid home and teaching them there (and around town, as needed or wanted). Part of legally keeping your kid home is notifying the district that you are invoking your right under law to homeschool. If you withdraw your kid <em>during</em> the school year, Minnesota law gives you 15 days to notify the district that you have withdrawn your kid. Minn. Stats. ยง 120A.24, subd.1(2). You have longer if you withdraw before the school year has started. A PDF of those laws is below: Links &gt; Minnesota Education Laws for Homeschool &gt; Minnesota Education Code.</p>
       </div>

<h3 class="collapsible">Step 6. Find curricula</h3>
<div class="content">

<p><em>*As indicated in Tip 3 above: as a homeschooling family, you can get free textbooks, tests, and other resources from the district, every year, to help you meet the curricular requirements described below.</em></p>
       
  <p>Minnesota law requires the teaching of these subjects: (1) basic communication skills including reading and writing, literature, and fine arts; (2) mathematics and science; (3) social studies including history, geography, economics, government, and citizenship; and (4) health and physical education. Minn. Stat. ยง Subd.9. A PDF of this law is below: Links &gt; Minnesota Education Laws for Homeschool &gt; Minnesota Education Code. Minnesota law does not define how to teach these subjects, nor does the law define grade-levels for the teaching. Still, the safest decision when dealing with laws is to act in good faith and be reasonable. Generally, when judging a vague standard, courts typically settle on determining whether conduct was reasonable.</p>
       
<p>Curricula are everywhere for homeschooling. Indeed, simple guidance from a parent on basic living may qualify to meet certain standards. For example, the health education standard may be met by a parent talking to their child about the importance of healthy eating and giving examples. Homeschooling can involve a lot of creativity.</p>

<p>If you want your wife to teach your child from ready-made texts, many companies offer that. Many homeschool expenses will qualify for a tax credit. To learn about that, visit the Minnesota Department of Revenue's webpage about the <a href="https://www.revenue.state.mn.us/k-12-education-subtraction-and-credit-0">Kโ12 Education Subtraction and Credit.</a> The Department also describes the <a href="https://www.revenue.state.mn.us/qualifying-home-school-expenses-k-12-education-subtraction-and-credit-0">Qualifying Home School Expenses for K-12 Education Subtraction and Credit </a></p>
       </div>

<h3 class="collapsible">Step 7. Find a qualified teacher or teachers</h3>
<div class="content">
  <p>Under Minnesota law, your wife, as your kid mother, is a qualified teacher. See Minn. Stat. ยง 120A.24, subd.10(5). Otherwise, a teacher qualified under law meets one or more of the following standards: (1) holds a valid Minnesota teaching license in the field and for the grade level taught;
(2) is directly supervised by a person holding a valid Minnesota teaching license;
(3) provides instruction in a school that is accredited by an accrediting agency, recognized according to section 123B.445, or recognized by the commissioner; or (4) has a bachelor's degree. Minn. Stat. ยง 120A.24, subd.10. A PDF of these laws is below: Links &gt; Minnesota Education Laws for Homeschool &gt; Minnesota Education Code.</p>
