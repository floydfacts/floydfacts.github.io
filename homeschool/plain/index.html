<p>These quick tips and links about homeschooling may help a conservative Christian father to guide his wife in homeschooling their children in Minnesota. This information is available to anyone but is not intended for any non-Christian, nor any non-conservative Christian. Also, the information is not intended for use by any conservative Christian wife directly. Rather, a wife should only access this information under the guidance and authority of her husband.</p>

<p>The first and best government contact for homeschooling is generally the superintendent's office for your kid's district. If you are unsure about how to contact that office, feel free to call your local school. Your local school can tell you how to contact the superintendent. The local school might be able to help with some questions; but, the school will need to refer you to the superintendent's office for some questions.</p>

<h3 class="accordion">2. Steps to Start XHS</h3>
 <div class="panel">
<p>Following are some steps for you to help your wife to start homeschooling in Minnesota. For a more thorough explanation of the process, visit the Minnesota Association of Christian Home Educators (MACH) at <a href="https://mache.org">mache.org</a>, and go to Resources &gt; How to Begin Homeschooling. MACHE also provides free <a href="https://mache.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Reporting-Forms-8_22.pdf">annual reporting forms</a>, as well as guidance about which form to use and when.</p>

       <li>Find curricula</li>
       <li>Find a qualified teacher or teachers</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h4 class="accordion">2.1. Clarify your motivations</h4>
	 <div class="panel">
  <p>The first step to start homeschooling is to understand why you want your wife to homeschool your children, instead of having the government as your children's teacher - <em>and then</em> to help her understand why.</p>
	 </div><!--panel-->
<h4 class="accordion">2.2. Clarify your goals</h4>
	 <div class="panel">
  <p>After determining why you want your wife to homeschool your children, next  <em>and</em> clarify, for yourself and your wife, the goals that you have for homeschool. Consider writing a list.</p>
</div><!--panel-->
<h4 class="accordion">2.3. Evaluate your wife's <em>desire</em></h4>
	 <div class="panel">
  <p>As a husband and father, you obviously have authority over your wife, and your role is to guide her. Moreover, the best exercise of your authority is to be fair and realistic about whether your wife really wants to homeschool.</p>
</div><!--panel-->
<h4 class="accordion">2.4. Evaluate your wife's <em>ability</em></h4>
	 <div class="panel">
  <p>Again, your best strategy here is to be fair and realistic. Even if your wife is <em>motivated</em> to homeschool, still, homeschooling could be beyond her ability and might overwhelm her. Consider allowing her to <em>try</em> homeschooling - and know that you can change back to non-homeschooling if homeschool turns out to be beyond your wife's ability for now. (And obviously consider letting her try again, even soon after failure, if she thinks, and you agree, that she may have improved her ability to homeschool.)</p>
</div><!--panel-->
<h4 class="accordion">2.5. Keep your kid home and notify the district</h4>
	 <div class="panel">
  <p>Homeschooling just means legally keeping your kid home and teaching them there (and around town, as needed or wanted). Part of legally keeping your kid home is notifying the district that you are invoking your right under law to homeschool. If you withdraw your kid <em>during</em> the school year, Minnesota law gives you 15 days to notify the district that you have withdrawn your kid. Minn. Stats. § 120A.24, subd.1(2). You have longer if you withdraw before the school year has started. A PDF of those laws is below: 7. Government &gt; Minnesota Homeschool Law &gt; Minnesota Education Code.</p>
  <p>The <em>Forms</em> section below has the forms needed to legally notify your school district that you will be homeschooling. Check Mache at 6.1 for free info on which forms to send and when.</p>
      </div><!--panel-->
<h4 class="accordion">2.6. Find a qualified teacher or teachers</h4>
	<div class="panel">
  <p>Under Minnesota law, your wife, as your kid mother, is a qualified teacher. See Minn. Stat. § 120A.24, subd.10(5). Otherwise, a teacher qualified under law meets one or more of the following standards:</p> 
  <ul>
  <li>holds a valid Minnesota teaching license in the field and for the grade level taught;</li>
<li>is directly supervised by a person holding a valid Minnesota teaching license;</li>
<li>provides instruction in a school that is accredited by an accrediting agency, recognized according to section 123B.445, or recognized by the commissioner; or</li>
<li>has a bachelor's degree. Minn. Stat. § 120A.24, subd.10. A PDF of those laws is below: 7. Government &gt; Minnesota Homeschool Law &gt; Minnesota Education Code.</li>
</ul>
      </div><!--panel-->
<h4 class="accordion">2.7. Find curricula</h4>
<div class="panel">
<p><em>*As indicated in Tip 3 below: as a homeschooling family, you can get free textbooks, tests, and other resources from the district, every year, to help you meet the curricular requirements described below.</em></p>
       
  <p>Minnesota law requires the teaching of these subjects:</p> 
<ol>
  <li>basic communication skills, including reading and writing, literature, and fine arts;</li>
  <li>mathematics and science;</li>
  <li>social studies including history, geography, economics, government, and citizenship; and</li>
  <li>health and physical education.</li></ol>
  
<p>Minn. Stat. § Subd.9. A PDF of that law is below: 7. Government &gt; Minnesota Homeschool Law &gt; Minnesota Education Code. Minnesota law does not define how to teach these subjects, nor does the law define grade-levels for the teaching. Still, the safest decision when dealing with laws is to act in good faith and be reasonable. Generally, when judging someone's compliance with an open-ended or vague standard, courts typically put a lot of emphasis on determining whether conduct was reasonable.</p>
       
<p>Meanwhile, curricula are everywhere for homeschooling. Indeed, simple guidance from a parent on basic living may qualify to meet certain standards. For example, the health education standard may be met by a parent talking to their child about the importance of healthy eating and giving examples. Homeschooling can involve a lot of creativity.</p>

<p>If you want your wife to teach your child from ready-made texts, many companies offer that. For some examples and ideas about tools for teaching, check section 5 below: Lessons and Curricula.</p>
	
<p>Also, many homeschool expenses will qualify to get you a tax credit. To learn about that, check below for Tip 5: Tax Help for Homeschool Expenses.</p>

</div>
       
<!-- TIP 1 ##########################################  -->
<h4 class="accordion">3.1. Government's Role in Homeschool</h4>
	<div class="panel">
<p>In the U.S., thus in Minnesota, homeschooling still involves the government. As citizens of the United States and Minnesota, we husbands and fathers agree to abide by the laws written by the men of the U.S. and Minnesota government. Regarding education, the U.S. federal government sets only broad laws. To receive federal education funding, a state must follow federal education laws. For more on that dynamic, read the Congressional Research Service's (CRS) <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10551">Summary of Federal Education Laws Administered by the U.S. Department of Education (2022 update)</a>. (The U.S. Congress directs the CRS, which is a nonpartisan entity tasked with conducting research to help Congress.) Again, the extent of those federal laws is to offer federal money to states for following certain basic laws of the U.S. Department of Education, which is federal.</p> 
       
<p>Meanwhile, nearly all government involvement in education arises under state law. Thus, as Minnesota fathers and husbands, we are concerned with the <em>Minnesota Education Code</em>, which Minnesota law defines as chapters 120A to 129C of the Minnesota statutes. Minn. Stat. 120A.01 ("Chapters 120A to 129C may be cited as the Education Code.").</p> 
       
<p>Beyond that, each local school district must follow its state's laws. A district may set its own local policies, as long as the local policies do not conflict with state law about education or civil rights. (Nor may the local policies conflict with federal laws, for example federal civil rights laws.)</p>
       
<p>Learn more about the Minnesota's education law below at 7.2.1. There, you will find a PDF of the Minnesota Education Code. I personally edited the code for clarity and relevance to conservative Christian husbands who are helping their wives to homeschool their children, or who are interested in starting. The PDF also has a link on its first page to the full, unedited Minnesota Education Code at the government's website.</p>
      </div><!--panel-->   
	
<!-- TIP 2 ##########################################  -->
<h4 class="accordion">3.2. Yearly Testing of Homeschool Kids</h4>
<div class="panel">
<p><em>*For information on getting free test materials from your district, see Tip 3 below. Also, the Minnesota Association of Christian Home Educators (MACHE) has some information about finding national standardized tests. MACHE may be reached with the information below: Minnesota XHS (Christian Homeschool) Groups &gt; MACHE.</em></p>
       
<p>Yearly Testing, General Rule: When your wife homeschools your kid, Minnesota law will generally require yearly testing of your kid: "a nationally norm-referenced standardized achievement examination." Minn. Stat. § 120A.22, subd.11(a).</p>
       
<p>Exceptions. Sub-section (b) of the above law exemmpts you from the general testing rule if your wife, or another who teaches your homeschooled child, meets one of the following three criteria:</p> 
<ol>
  <li>has a Minnesota teaching license for the subject and grade-level taught; or</li>
  <li>is directly supervised by a person with a Minnesota teaching license; or</li>
  <li>instructs in a school accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by (a) the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Education, or (b) the nonpublic education council, under section 123B.445 of the Minnesota Education Code (available at 7.2.1 below).</li>
  </ol>
       
<p>Read about the laws cited by going below to 7.2.1.</p>
         </div><!--panel-->
	
<!-- TIP 3 ##########################################  -->
<h4 class="accordion">3.3. Free Textbooks, Tests, and Software</h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>You local district has a duty under law to honor your request if you ask for certain resources to homeschool your child. For more about that, check the sources below at 7.2.2. &gt; 123B.42 (Textbooks; Individual Instruction or Cooperative Learning Material; Standard Tests).</p>

<p>Here is an example of the the laws.</p>

<p><strong>123B.42 Textbooks; Individual Instruction or Cooperative Learning Material; Standard Tests.</strong></p>
       
<p><strong>Subdivision 1. District Providing Free Education Materials and Tests for Homeschooled Kids.</strong> The commissioner of education shall promulgate rules under the provisions of chapter 14 requiring that in each school year, based upon formal requests by or on behalf of nonpublic school pupils in a nonpublic school, the local districts or intermediary service areas must purchase or otherwise acquire textbooks, individualized instructional or cooperative learning materials, software or other educational technology, and standardized tests and loan or provide them for use by children enrolled in that nonpublic school. These textbooks, individualized instructional or cooperative learning materials, software or other educational technology, and standardized tests must be loaned or provided free to the children for the school year for which requested. The loan or provision of the textbooks, individualized instructional or cooperative learning materials, and standardized tests shall be subject to rules prescribed by the commissioner of education.</p>
       
<p><strong>Subd. 1a. District Providing Free Electronic and Software parts of Curriculum to Homeschooled Kids.</strong> A school district that provides curriculum to resident students that has both physical and electronic components must make the electronic component accessible to a resident student in a home school in compliance with sections 120A.22 and 120A.24 at the request of the student or the student's parent or guardian, provided that the district does not incur more than an incidental cost as a result of providing access electronically.</p>

  </div><!--panel-->
	
<!-- TIP 6 ##########################################  -->
<h4 class="accordion">3.6. Homeschool Record Keeping</h4>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Minnesota will require you and your wife to keep records of the resources and material that you use to teach your kid about the required subjects. The law describes what to keep as a record. See Minn. Stat. § 120A.24, subd.2(a). A PDF of that law is below at 7.2.1.</p>

    </div><!--panel-->
	
<!-- TIP 8 ##########################################  -->
 <h4 class="accordion">3.8. Early Graduation or Exclusion</h4>
	<div class="panel">
<p>Minnesota law exempts from compulsory education any student (homeschooled or otherwise) who either (a) finishes the eighth grade, or else (b) graduates from high school (and for a homeschooled student, high school graduation arises by whatever criteria the parent sets). Legal analysis of these points follows.</p>

<p>Minnesota law exempts graduated students from compulsory education. Minn. Stat. 120A.22, subd.5(a) (exempting graduated children from compulsory instruction). Generally, a student may be graduated as soon as they complete the necessary work: "Any [high school] student who has completed all required courses or standards may, with the approval of the student, the student's parent or guardian, and local school officials, graduate before the completion of the school year." Minn. Stat. 120B.07.</p>
	
<p>In any case, state law cannot compel education beyond the 8th grade. <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder</em>, 406 U.S. 205 (1972); cf. Minnesota Department of Education, <em>Home School Education: Home-School Questions and Answers</em> (2023), <a href="https://education.mn.gov/mde/fam/nphs/home">https://education.mn.gov/mde/fam/nphs/home</a> (stating that students have "a right to discontinue education, reporting and testing following eighth
grade" (echoing the <em>Yoder</em> decision)).</p>
	
<p>A child may pass the eighth grade by passing a lawful eighth-grade test. The Minnesota Department of Education lists some lawful tests. University of Minnesota, Welcome to the Minnesota Statewide Testing Program Store (n.d.), https://mstp-umn.nbsstore.net. A child passes a grade-level test by scoring above the 30th percentile. Minn. Stat. 120A.22 Subd.11(c) (2023) (mandating remediation only if a child's performance on the test "is at or below the 30th percentile").</p>

  <!-- SECTION: Reasons #######################################  -->

<h3 class="accordion">4. Reasons to XHS</h3>
<div id="reasons" class="panel">

<p>As our society collapses and reorganizes, a conservative Christian father (CCF) must protect his wife and their children from degeneracy and other danger in society. As a key example, a CCF must carefully guide his wife about schooling for their kids. Many good reasons will motivate a CCF to choose homeschool for his children. Some important reasons follow.</p>

<li>Public School is Often Dangerous</li>

<li>Every Public School Lies About Vaccines</li>
<li>Every Public School Lied About Covid</li>
<li>Public Schools Champion the Transcult</li>
</ol>
	
</div>

<h4 class="accordion">4.1. Public Schools Reject a Father's Authority</h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>Parents, especially fathers - not the state - have ultimate authority over their children. Yet many minions' of government-run public schools completely and openly reject the authority of fathers. Disregard for a father's (and mother's) authority obviously speaks for itself and is already the stuff of legends. Still, two examples follow - grabbed at random today, from among the hundreds of examples that could be easily given. (To find the examples, I simply searched "parental rights education.") The rejection of fathers' authority by minions of government-run public schools: this will motivate every reasonable father to strongly consider helping his wife to homeschool their children.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Parents' rights . . . [undermine] . . . math, science, and reading" - according to some crazy old culturally Jewish atheist lady with a law degree from Harvard.[1] Many anti-family fools share the crazy old lady's bad opinion. For example, socialist minions of the National Education Association (NEA) denounce, as a "destructive agenda," laws against teaching children the alphabet cult's sexual degeneracy agenda.[2] Elsewhere, the NEA, which is the largest teachers union, openly promotes the sexualized destruction of children - and decries real and imagined "bias and intolerance" against their sexual-degeneracy cult.[3] </li>
<li>"Too much" parental involvement "undermine[s] behavioral development" of children - according to some crazy old lady at Stanford whose smile now looks like a frown, as she echoes a childless University-of-Minnesota-trained psychologist.[4] Elsewhere, evidence shows what the crazy old lady probably means by parents undermining their children's "behavioral development": two years earlier, the crazy old lady reported that high school students are often "unprepared to judge the credibility of information on the internet." As evidence, the crazy old lady cited people disagreeing with her and her political teammates about their climate alarmist myths and other unscientific propaganda.[5]</li>

<h4 class="accordion">4.7. Public Schools Champion the Transcult</h4>
<div class="panel">
<p>"Liars hate the people they hurt"<br/>Proverbs 26:28, NCV</p>
<p>Public schools champion the transcult. Meanwhile, plenty evidence clearly shows that the transcult hates its minions. As a major category of this evidence, the transcult routinely disguises its own failures as flaws of its opponents. For example, the transcult constantly lurks around unhappy people - especially unhappy young people - and seeks to recruit the unhappy people to the transcult. The transcult's lowest goal is to tempt the unhappy people into believing that sexually mutilation will cure their unhappiness. The sexual mutilation invariably and predictably fails to cure the unhappiness. Self-murder routinely follows. When self-murder happens after sexual mutilation, the transcult never blames the self-murder on the foolish, unscientific, and satanic strategy of self-mutilation. Instead, the transcult blames the self-murder on their political opponents: if only the transcult's opponents had thrown more money at, or parades for, the unhappy person whom the transcult sexually mutilated, then the unhappy person would not have self-murdered. This is basic and pathetic projection and deflection. The transcult loves misery, mutilation, and death. Public schools champion the transcult. Escape public school immediately. This website describes how to escape legally.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.ixl.com">IXL</a> is a paid service ($20/mo for one kid and, I believe, just another $5 per kid to add more). IXL has been really nice, especially for keeping track of progress. This is super helpful for the student to see how far they have come -- and is also a ready-made way for parents to comply with the Minnesota government's requirement that homeschooling parents keep a record of what the homeschool kids are learning.(Learn more about the recording requirements below, at 7.2.1.)</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.home-school.com">Homeschool World</a> offers a lot of material. However, the site is laid out very poorly. I almost did not include it as a resource here, but I kept digging because I wanted to find a good reason to present the site. And I found a great reason (one of many). The site has a <a href="https://www.home-school.com/gettingstarted/">getting started</a> page. The page has a lot of great ideas about how - and why - to homeschool. The resource that sold me on including the website here is a free infographic on that page, titled "<a href="https://www.home-school.com/news/why-should-i-homeschool.php">Why should I homeschool</a>." The infographic give good information on seven great reasons to homeschool: (1) less drug exposure, (2) emotional benefits, (3) ritalin-free (that point, alone, sold me on promoting the website), (4) removes sexual pressure (and that point), (5) builds family bonds, (6) prepares for real world, and (7) optimal for spiritual training.</p>

<h4 class="accordion">1. Who I am</h4>
	<div class="panel">
<p>My name is R. Floyd Lindquist. My main website is <a href="https://floydfacts.github.io/">Floyd Facts</a> (still mostly under construction), where I offer free information, and paid consultancy, about counseling, health, nutrition, U.S. law, and Thanatology (grief, trauma, loss, resilience, and so forth). I created this website to inform conservative Christian fathers about how they can help their wives to homeschool their children. The site focuses mainly on lawfully escaping <em>Minnesota</em> public schools. Still, the information can be adapted and adjusted to escape the public schools of other U.S. states and territories. Two overall reasons motivated me to make this website: (1) public schools are corrupt, and (2) false teammates are unhelpful and even dangerous. I describe those points a little more below - although, for my target audience, not much else needs to be said.</p>
			  </div><!--panel-->
	
<h4 class="accordion">2. Public Schools Are Corrupt</h4>
	<div class="panel">
<p>USA's government-run "public" schools are corrupt and dangerous. They are anti-family mind-sewers of socialism and moral relativity. USA's government-run "public" schools openly promote the total destruction of parental authority and the total subjugation of children by the state. Escape public school however you can - then avoid them, except to facilitate an escape for other Christian families.</p>
		  </div><!--panel-->
	
<h4 class="accordion">3. POSIWID</h4> 
<div class="panel">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does">POSIWID</a>: <em>the Purpose Of a System Is What It Does</em>.</p> 

<p>Regardless the <em>intentions</em> of those who design, operate, or promote a system: POSIWID: the Purpose Of a System Is What It Does. A system has no <em>side</em> effects: only <em>effects</em>. For example, the United States federal government has a political system for immunization, including vaccines (whether actual or pretended). In its published warnings about the possible "side effects" from vaccines, the United States federal government reports that all vaccines may cause "serious injury or death." CDC, <em>Possible Side effects from Vaccines</em> (2020), <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm</a>. Meanwhile, these serious injuries and deaths are not <em>side</em> effects. Nothing is a <em>side</em> effect. No system - at all, ever - has any <em>side</em> effect: systems only have effects. And POSIWID: the purpose of a system is what it does.</p> 

<p>Some systems arise by an aim to improve a risk. Continuing with the vaccine example: vaccines often arise to improve against the risk of serious injury or death from vaccine-preventable disease. When improvement does happen, <em>that</em> is the purpose of the vaccine system. Equally, when vaccines maim or kill: <em>that</em> is the vaccine system's <em>purpose</em> - regardless the <em>intentions</em> of those who design, operate, or promote the system. Moreover, when agents of a government lie by hiding or downplaying vaccine injury or death - or lie more directly and aggressively by threats or violence to force vaccinations, despite the the predictable and routine serious injuries or deaths: <em>that</em> is the purpose of the government's vaccine program. POSIWID: the purpose of a system is what it does. This is true of all systems, including government-run "public" education.</p>

<p>Obviously, USA's government-run "public" education mostly teaches not <em>how</em> to think but rather <em>what</em> to think. The word for that is indoctrination. Often, indoctrination by government-run "public" school destroys a student's development of <em>how</em> to think. Again: POSIWID. Thus, the <em>purpose</em> of U.S. public education is routinely to teach <em>what</em> to think - <em>by destroying <u>how</u> to think</em>. This hardly deserves frantic or desperate action. Instead, the government's treachery through government-run "public" education deserves action decisive, purposeful, and consistent. Homeschool as soon as possible, for as long as possible because government-run "public" school is dangerous and destructive - and that is its purpose.</p>
	  </div><!--panel-->
	
<h4 class="accordion">4. Avoid False Teammates</h4> 
	<div class="panel">
<p>When escaping and avoiding USA's corrupt and dangerous government-run "public" schools: guard against the temptation to team up with degenerates. Public schools harms everyone; so, public schools are being avoided by plenty people who do not deserve any help or fellowship. Like the refugees from California who are now California-ing Texas and elsewhere: many of public school's victims are part of the problem. It is not nearly enough that they will try to cling onto you in a desperate attempt to absolve themselves of the predictable, indeed inevitable, consequences of their social and political degeneracy. As a related example: Dave Rubin is a popular republican podcaster known for calling out anti-conservative bias. In 2022, he and his "husband" purchased two children through surrogacy. The enemy of your enemy is not always your friend.</p>
