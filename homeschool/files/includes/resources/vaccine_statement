<p><em>If you do not want to vaccinate your children because you believe the CDC when the CDC says that vaccines can injure or kill your children, then feel free to follow these three steps: (1) print the following statement, (2) sign it in front of a notary, and (3) submit it to your school district. That will exempt your children under Minnesota law.</em></p>
  
<p>This statement exempts my child(ren) from immunization requirements under Minnesota law. Minnesota law generally requires certain immunizations. Minn. Stat. ยง 121A.15. The law exempts my child(ren) because I believe that immunizations are inherently dangerous. Cf. id. subd.3(d) (exempting from immunization requirements those children whose parents have a conscientiously held belief against immunizations). My belief is conscientious because the CDC reports that immunizations may cause "serious injury or death." CDC, Possible Side effects from Vaccines (2020), https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm. This statement satisfies the law: I do not need to use your form. (Subdivision 8's requirement of a standard form concerns the <em>superintendent's</em> report to the Commissioner of health - <em>not</em> my report to the superintendent.)</p>
