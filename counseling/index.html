		      <h3 class="accordion">Approach</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>My approach to counseling lends generally to being described as psychodynamics. Merriam-Webster's defintion of the psychodynamics approach says enough: that the approach focuses on "the psychology of mental or emotional forces or processes developing especially in early childhood and their effects on behavior and mental states." However, my psychodynamics approach focuses especially on the harms caused by the feckless and fraudulent clinicians who now infest infest, or who have infested, psychiatry and psychology. For example, I often address how many a modern mental mess arises by the fraud of violent misogynistic fool Sigmund Freud (who, coincidentally, generally receives credit for the invention of the psychodynamic approach.) So, I call my framework "Psychiatrist and Psychologist Gaslighting Fraud Rejection Therapy" - or, more simply, Floydian Psychodynamics.</p>
      
<h4>Floydian Psychodynamics: Psychiatrist and Psychologist Gaslighting Fraud Rejection Therapy</h4>

<p>Many modern and classic problems and their solutions arise <em>apart and distinct from</em> the dispicable and rampant gaslighting by yesterday and today's degenerate psychiatrists and psychologists. Still, that gaslighting does harm and ruin many, across the nation and around the world. So, for now, helping others to heal from psychiatry's violent fraud is a key focus of my counseling. More fundamentally, I hold to a lineage of rogue psychiatrists and psychologists who have, whether somewhat or totally, recovered and repented from their association with psychiatry and psychology - and often actively rejected the frauds. A famous example is psychiatrist Dr. Thomas Szaz (1920-2012), who is probably the most famous clinician to completely reject the fraud of "mental illness" and psychiatry more generally. Still, the enemy of my enemy is often hardly a friend. So is it with Szasz - who was, overall, a degenerate fool who rabidly promoted narcotics and even suicide. Yet, even someone as sick and stupid as Szasz could see the danger, corruption, and degeneracy of psychiatry.</p> 

<p>Meanwhile, the psychiatry industry, itself, even confidently identifies itself as a completely demented profession. One need only read its book: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). There, in the DSM, the scum of psychiatry say, among much else, that normal people - especially children - who simply displease a clinician's paying client: they have one or more of various mental and behavioral "disorders," such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism, Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Meanwhile, none of the diagnostic criteria for any of those scam diagnoses are even the slightest bit objective. Meanwhile, also: that same book says that choosing to sexually torture people is not a disorder if the torturer (a) feels no emotional distress (in the opinion of the clinician) about sexually torturing people, and (b) only sexually tortures people who willingly participate. Likewise, the DSM states that choosing to be sexually tortured is not a disorder if the tortured person feels no emotional distress (in the opinion of the clinician) about their interest in being sexually tortured. For those doubting any of that: just read the DSM, fifth edition, page 694. Unsuprisingly, the dangerous and degenerate fools have created their own living hell. For evidence of that, just search something "suicide epidemic psychiatrists." These are the fools and frauds of psychiatry and psychology who claim a unique ability to help fix and improve people. And this is why I aim especially to help the victims of psychiatry's fraud.</p>

<p>Moreover, as one neuroscientist psychiatrist put it, echoing an old adage: "We don't manage well what we don't measure well" (Chauvin & Insel, 2018). Meanwhile, no one can measure well things that are defined by the lies of bad parents (usually moms) and bad teachers (especially women teaching boys), and by the greed and sloth of worse clinicians. The neuroscientist psychiatrist continues: "In the absence of reliable instruments, clinicians treating mental illness use indirect, intuition-based  measures. The DSM-5, the principal schema for classifying mental disorders, requires clinicians to form diagnoses based on their subjective judgments and arbitrary cut-off points." So, there you have it: psychiatry - that is to say, every single "diagnosis" in psychiatry - is arbitrary, subjective, and "intuition-based." Phrased another way: the evil of psychiatry, in addition to being obviously corrupt and abusive, is also simply and completely <u>unscientific</ul>.</p>

<!-- compelled speech ############################################################################# -->

<h3 class="accordion compelled_heading">Speech Compelled by Government</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>As president Ronald Reagan's speechwriter famously put it: "The nine most frightening words in the English language are, <em>I'm from the government, and I'm here to help</em>." (Yes: It is eleven words, but the point remains.)</p>
      <p>In an effort to give some of that famous government help, the Minnesota government compels the speech in the following section.</p>
		
		
      <h4 class="accordion compelled">Complementary and Alternative Health Care Client Bill Of Rights</h4>
		<div class="panel">
      <p>This section of compelled speech arises under <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/146A.11">Minnesota Statute, section 146A.11.</a> For the following sections, the "practitioner" is me.</p>
      <p>My name is R. Floyd Lindquist. My complementary and alternative health care title is doctor,* lawyer,* counselor, nutritionist,* psychologist,* thanatologist, teacher, conversationalist - or just Floyd (or Russ).</p>
      <p>All titles above with a * are illegal to use by anyone whom the government does not license. Meanwhile, I am not licensed to use the titles, but I use them anyways. For some explanation, go up to the section <em>limits of help</em>. Most generally, as to law: I use the titles because the government wildly exceeds its authority under the Constitution by completely outlawing words like "nutritionist" for supposedly non-nutritionists: people who, like me, are nutritionists by training - but decline to pay never-ending penalties (license fees, continuing education requirements, etc.) to use so basic and descriptive a word as <em>nutritionist</em>.</p> 
		
	  <p>Jurisprudentially, this is a matter of constitutional law arising under the 14th amendment's two-part strict-scrutiny standard: the government must (1) reasonably allege a compelling state interest, <em>and</em> (2) use the least-restrictive-means to acheive that interest. Here, protecting the public from fake doctors, fake nutritionists, and fake lawyers is indeed a compelling state interets; however, banning entire sets of basic and descriptive words is hardly the least restrictive means to acheive such an interest. Instead, under the Constitution, the government may resrict terms like "licensed nutritionist" or "licensed medical doctor" or "licensed attorney" - but not restrict all use of words like nutritionists, doctor, or lawyer. This is my legal advice - as a lawyer.</p>
      <p>A sense of the degrees, training, experience, and other qualifications of the practitioner regarding the complementary and alternative health care being provided - can be read from the <a href="/files/pdf/cv.pdf">pieces of paper</a>.</p>
      <p>Now follows a particularly goofy bit of speech that the government compels.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The state of Minnesota has not adopted any educational and training standards for unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioners. this statement of credentials is for information purposes only. Under Minnesota law, an unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioner may not provide a medical diagnosis or recommend discontinuance of medically prescribed treatments. If a client desires a diagnosis from a licensed physician, chiropractor, or acupuncture practitioner, or services from a physician, chiropractor, nurse, osteopathic physician, physical therapist, dietitian, nutritionist, acupuncture practitioner, athletic trainer, or any other type of health care provider, the client may seek such services at any time.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The name of my complementary and alternative health care practice is just my name: R. Floyd Lindquist. There is no physical address associated with my practice. The email address associated with my practice is floydfacts[at]yahoo[dot]com.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The practitioner's fees per unit of service are one million dollars per century. The practitioner's method of billing for such fees is the honor system. The practitioner is not authorized to accept Medicare or medical assistance.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The practitioner is willing to accept partial payment, or to waive payment, if the practitioner believes that the client deserve partial payment or waiver of payment.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client has a right to reasonable notice of changes in services or charges.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The theoretical approach used by the practitioner in providing services to clients is, in essence, various forms of conversation to help the clients deal with the stresses and conflicts of normal life, and especially challenging life - including subjection to a bloated and often lawless government, as well as a collapsing culture infested with so many degenerate frauds and fools</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client has a right to complete and current information concerning the practitioner's assessment and recommended service that is to be provided, including the expected duration of the service to be provided. Clients may expect courteous treatment and to be free from verbal, physical, or sexual abuse by the practitioner. Client records and transactions with the practitioner are confidential, unless release of these records is authorized in writing by the client, or otherwise provided by law. The client has a right to access records and written information from records in accordance with the Minnesota Health Records Act: <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/144.291">Minnesota statutes, sections 144.291 to 144.298</a></p>
      <p class="compelled">Other services may be available in the community. Information concerning the other services is available through the government.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client has the right to choose freely among available practitioners and to change practitioners after services have begun, within the limits of health insurance, medical assistance, or other health programs. The client has a right to coordinated transfer when there will be a change in the provider of services.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client may refuse services or treatment, unless otherwise provided by law,* and the client may assert the client's rights without retaliation.</p>
      <p>*NOTE: the government-mandated section above mentions that some clients many not refuse services. That is a reference to such corrupt government minions as the psychiatrists and psychologists whom the government lets "treat" people, even when the person does not want "treatment." Obviously, then that is not really treatment: obviously, that is a form of legalized, medicalized slavery and torture.</p>

<h3 class="accordion compelled_heading">U.S. Government’s Medical Takeover</h3>
  <div class="panel">
<p>Apropos of the previous section of speech compelled by the government, following is a brief analysis that highlights some of the evil history of the U.S. government's medical takeover. It is a history of government's tyrannical and systematic destruction of the family order, especially paternal authority (<em>paternal</em> - not - "parental"). The history includes government-run eugenics, mass-mutilation, and mass-murder.</p>
<p>In the late 1800s, U.S. state governments began taking over medicine. Government’s medical takeover started with the U.S. Supreme Court upholding government takeover of medicine in West Virginia.[1] Affirming the West Virginia government’s takeover of medicine, the U.S. Supreme Court invented the following bloated and lawless standard:</p>

<blockquote>The power of the State to provide for the general welfare of its people authorizes it to prescribe all such regulations as in its judgment will secure or tend to secure them against the consequences of ignorance and incapacity, as well as of deception and fraud.[2]</blockquote>

<p>Unsurprisingly, increasingly bloated and lawless governments began leveraging that bloated and lawless Supreme Court invention to create a medical monopoly where the state picks winners and denounces all alternatives as matters of ignorance, deception, and fraud. Eventually, state governments criminalized virtually all <em>unofficial</em> conversations about any medical problems - and defined medical problems as broadly as “sizing up” or “comprehending” <u>any</u> “physical or mental status.”[3]</p>

<h4>Resistance to Government’s Takeover of Medicine</h4>

<p>When government began taking over medicine, countless medical men immediately resisted. This resistance included chiropractors. A few years after the government takeover of medicine, chiropractors started the National School of Chiropractic to protect and advance their style of healthcare. (The school was renamed to the National University Of Health Sciences, in 2000.)Religious medical men also especially resisted government’s takeover of medicine, particularly because government began directing medicine by outlawing various good practices, while allowing and even demanding certain evil practices. A few obvious examples of the evil follow.</p>

<h4>Government Run Eugenics and Mass-mutilation, as well as Forced Vaccination of Vaccine-damaged Individuals</h4>

<p>In 1905, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the Massachusetts government’s penalties against a vaccine-injured priest.[4] Two decades later, evil republican eugenicists on the U.S. Supreme Court (including the Court’s first degenerate Zionist, Louis Brandeis) cited that Massachusetts case when declaring that the men of the Virginia government had the constitutional right to deputize members of its medical monopoly to mutilate a woman’s reproductive order, in order to sterilize her against her will:</p>

<blockquote>“It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”[5]</blockquote>

<h4>Government-run (and Republican-led) Mass-murder Euphmized as Healthcare - and the War Against Fathers' Rights and Duties</h4>

<p>Echoing those evil republican eugenicists, an evil republican degenerate on the Supreme Court wrote the Roe v. Wade (1973) decision, which codified the myth that healthcare includes government conspiring with a deadbeat mom to murder a man’s children. Later, evil Republicans on the Supreme Court - led by the Court’s first degenerate republican feminist, Sandra Day O'Connor - declared that child-murdering conspiracies between government and deadbeat moms were more important than a father’s right to oppose those murderous conspiracies.[6]</p>

<h4>Tyranny and Mass-mutilation in Today's (mostly Bipartisan) Medical-police-state</h4>

<p>About a century after the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the supposed authority of the Massachusetts government to harass and punish a vaccine-injured priest, every federal and state government across the United States leveraged those evil precedents to pretend a justification to criminale going outside, breathing normally, and so forth - during the tyrannical and treasonous medical-martial-law of the covid lockdowns.[7] Now, government's evil medical takeover focuses on, among other things, normalizing chemical and surgical mutilation satanically euphemized as gender affirming care.[8]</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The above analysis describes the political context, modern and historical, where incompetent and corrupt people in government have pretended, and do now pretend, the authority to dictate who can help whom in matters of health. To say the least, the costs - financial <em>and</em> moral  - are immeasurable to enforce this corrupt and degenerate tyranny. Government can have a legitimate role in ensuring honesty and competency by and among medical providers. However, the ongoing government takeover that now repeats generation after generation: it is simply bloated and evil. Indeed, it is a crime against humanity.</p>
