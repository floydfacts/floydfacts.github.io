  <p>This section of the website links to help that I can offer: advice, resources, warnings, and examples of previous and upcoming help. (This website is new and still under construction.) First, read the following section about consent.</p>
  <h3 class="accordion">Consent</h3>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>Good help is effective <em>and</em> ethical. Ethical help requires <em>consent</em>: the helped person must <em>agree</em> to the help. True consent requires <em>understanding</em>: the helping person must fully inform the helped person about the benefits, limits, and risks of help. Modern law terms this formula <em>informed consent</em>. Good help - ethical help - requires informed consent.</p>
	  <p><strong>Click the following sections to read a description of the benefits, limits, and risks of the help that I offer.</strong></p> <p>Below those descriptions is the compelled speech that the government requires from complementary and alternative healthcare providers, such as myself, who choose to help others without getting any licenses from the state.</p>
	</div>

  
      <h3 class="accordion">Benefits of My Help</h3>

    <div class="panel">
      <p>At best, my help may help someone to help themselves: to improve his understanding of himself, his family, other people, society, government, the rules of life, and so forth. For more about the kinds of things that I know about for helping, check my <a href="/files/pdf/cv.pdf">pieces of paper.</a></p>
    </div><!--benefits-->
	
      <h3 class="accordion">Limits of My Help</h3>

    <div class="panel">
      <p>Most importantly: nothing that I offer as help can save anyone from themselves. Also, it is illegal for me to claim any title or ability about any of the things that the government has hoarded for itself through licensing. (For more about that hoarding, see the section below: "History of U.S. Government’s Medical Takeover.")</p>
      <p>So, for example, I have a Master's degree in Nutrition; but, I cannot legally call myself a "nutritionist" - because the government hoards that title for people who jump through several expense and objectively unnecessary steps (for example, never-ending payments to the government, including through the never-ending "continuing education" political scam). Same with public health: I have a Master's degree in public health, focused on epidemiology and nutrition; but, I cannot claim to know anything about how disease works, except in the most abstract and informative - indirect - sense.</p>
      <p>I also have three doctorate degrees: a PsyD (doctorate of psychology), a PhD in Thanatology, and a Doctorate of Law and Policy. Yet, I cannot call myself a "doctor" in the context of any help that I offer as an alternative healthcare provider. I cannot even legally call myself a doctor of law when helping with legal information that I give to people to help reduce their stress about dealing with legal situations. Meanwhile, this issue is a corrupt and politicized mess</p>
      <p>One instructive example is "Dr." Jill Biden. She has a notoriously mediocre doctorate: education. Dr. Jill also has a <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/jill-bidens-doctorate-is-garbage-because-her-dissertation-is-garbage/">notoriously terrible doctoral dissertation</a> that got her gifted that degree. (Still, Jill is not as bad as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-10-11-mn-189-story.html">fraudster and plagiarist  MLK</a>.) Nevertheless, White House propagandists <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbbg8-PokfI">introduced her</a> as "Dr. Jill Biden" - and an "expert" - when propping up Dr. Jill (and fraudster Anthony Fauci) to promote the fake non-vaccine during the covid medical-martial-law tyranny. The government casually lies when calling Jill Biden a doctor. Thus, I will casually telling the truth and call myself a doctor in the context of the various helps that I offer. Nevertheless, the hypocrites in the government illegally forbid me from using the title "doctor":</p>
		
	<p class="quote">"The commissioner [or health] may impose disciplinary action . . .  against any unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioner." Minn. Stat. § 146A.08, subd.1(a). "The following conduct is prohibited and is grounds for disciplinary action: . . . Use of the title 'doctor, 'Dr.,' or 'physician' . . . to describe the complementary and alternative health care practices the practitioner provides." <u>Id</u>. (a),(w).</p> 
		
	<p>As punishment for calling oneself "doctor," the law provides for censure, a fine, and more - and the law also includes the illegally vague phrase that the penalty for calling oneself "Dr." or "doctor" may include "<u>any other action</u> justified by the case." <u>Id</u>. § 146A.09, subd.1(7) (emphasis added). However, if the government were to try enforcing penalties based on that illegally vague subsection, then the presiding court would be bound, under Supreme Court precedent, to find the law <em>void for vagueness</em>. <u>Cf.</u> United States Congress, Amdt5.8.1 Overview of Void for Vagueness Doctrine (n.d.), <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt5-8-1/ALDE_00013739/">https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt5-8-1/ALDE_00013739</a> ("Criminal statutes that lack sufficient definiteness or specificity are commonly held void for vagueness.") (citing <u>Cantwell v. Connecticut</u>, 310 U.S. 296, 308 (1940)). Meanwhile, as stated above, the law gives the above illegal (and legal) punishing power to the <em>commissioner of health</em>. Minn. Stat. § 146A.08, subd.1(a). That is an unelected bureaucrat. <u>See</u> Minn. Dep't of Health, Commissioner Brooke Cunningham (updated 2024, April 3), <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/about/org/eo/cunningham.html">https://www.health.state.mn.us/about/org/eo/cunningham.html</a>. Currently, Minnesota's health commissioner is Brooke Cunningham: some lady who was gifted an affirmative-action medical degree by the sometimes-prestigious and prominent medical program at Duke University (and other medical training by the degenerate child-torturing criminals and fraudsters at Johns Hopkins University) - after earning the immense undergraduate medcial training of a Bachelor's degree in African American studies. <u>See</u> <u>id</u>. It is lazy tyranny and laughable fraud for the government to give statewide dictatorial powers over medicine and health to anyone - especially someone so stunningly mediocre.</p>
		
	<p>The above hypocrisy, criminality, and fraud by the government, in addition to my three earned doctoroate degrees, is why I am totally fine with describing myself as a "doctor" (and a <em>lawyer</em>, and a <em>psychologist</em>, and a <em>thantologist</em>). I will also call myself a nutritionist, and a counselor, and any other basic description for which I reasonably qualify - even though lawless members of our bloated government outlaw those titles for anyone who, again, refuses to jump through countless expensive, unnecessary, and never-ending political hoops. Still, as I describe in the next section on <em>legal risks</em>: getting my help does carry the risk that unelected government bureaucrats may, at any moment and without any good reason, seek to formally outlaw me from helping you - because I call myself "Dr.," like the government calls mediocre fraudster Jill Biden a <em>doctor</em> to prop up her lies about the government's medical martial law, death-shots, suffocation mandates, and so forth.</p>

      <h3 class="accordion">Risks of My Help</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>All help, including mine, has risks. Following are examples of those risks, in four categories: personal, familial, social, legal.</p>
    
		<h4>Personal Risk</h4>
	<p><em>Personal risks</em> may arise by accepting my help. For example, my help may frustrate or stress a given client. Thus, there is the unavoidable and important risk of spending money only to end up feeling worse.</p>
		
		<h4>Familial Risk</h4>
		<p><em>Familial risks</em> may arise by accepting my help. Famous examples of familial risks include where a husband or father receives help, acts on that help - and then is resented. One obvious risk about this is if a husband learns to require authority over his wife, for the first time in his life - and then she ends up resenting that he is no longer so easily manipulated by her. (Of course, while that risk is real, still, the more likely consequence of a husband learning to lead will be that his wife feels relieved.)</p>
				
		<h4>Social Risk</h4>
		<p><em>Social risks</em> may arise by accepting my help. These risks include those describe above in the section on <em>familial risks</em>. Also, guilt by association is massive in our collapsing culture. As you can tell by reading this website, associating with me could highly risk that guilt-by-association.(This is why I leave out the names of my main universities - those from which I earned full degrees - and mention no individual professional relationship. Cancel culture is real - and dangerous.)</p>
					
		<h4>Legal Risk</h4>
		<p><em>Legal risks</em> may arise by accepting my help. For example, someone may act on legal information that I give - good information - and end up in trouble with the law because the person on the other side of the issue is either corrupt, connected, or otherwise, so the law does not apply to them. Also, laws frequently change, so information that is good when I give is - might be outdated by the time someone chooses to use it. This is a key reason that I am careful to couch my legal information as references to government sources that can be verified - initially and later on to check for changes. (State laws on government websites are a good example of this.)</p>

	<!-- compelled speech ############################################################################# -->

<h3 class="accordion compelled_heading">Speech Compelled by Government</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>As president Ronald Reagan's speechwriter famously put it: "The nine most frightening words in the English language are, <em>I'm from the government, and I'm here to help</em>." (Yes: It is eleven words, but the point remains.)</p>
      <p>In an effort to give some of that famous government help, the Minnesota government compels the speech in the following section.</p>
      <h5 class="compelled">Complementary and Alternative Health Care Client Bill Of Rights</h5>
      <p>This section of compelled speech arises under <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/146A.11">Minnesota Statute, section 146A.11.</a> For the following sections, the "practitioner" is me.</p>
      <p>My name is R. Floyd Lindquist. My complementary and alternative health care title is doctor,* lawyer,* counselor, nutritionist,* psychologist,* thanatologist, teacher, conversationalist - or just Floyd (or Russ).</p>
      <p>All titles above with a * are illegal to use by anyone whom the government does not license. Meanwhile, I am not licensed to use the titles, but I use them anyways. For some explanation, go up to the section <em>limits of help</em>. Most generally, as to law: I use the titles because the government wildly exceeds its authority under the Constitution by completely outlawing words like "nutritionist" for supposedly non-nutritionists: people who, like me, are nutritionists by training - but decline to pay never-ending penalties (license fees, continuing education requirements, etc.) to use so basic and descriptive a word as <em>nutritionist</em>.</p> 
		
	  <p>Jurisprudentially, this is a matter of constitutional law arising under the 14th amendment's two-part strict-scrutiny standard: the government must (1) reasonably allege a compelling state interest, <em>and</em> (2) use the least-restrictive-means to acheive that interest. Here, protecting the public from fake doctors, fake nutritionists, and fake lawyers is indeed a compelling state interets; however, banning entire sets of basic and descriptive words is hardly the least restrictive means to acheive such an interest. Instead, under the Constitution, the government may resrict terms like "licensed nutritionist" or "licensed medical doctor" or "licensed attorney" - but not restrict all use of words like nutritionists, doctor, or lawyer. This is my legal advice - as a lawyer.</p>
      <p>A sense of the degrees, training, experience, and other qualifications of the practitioner regarding the complementary and alternative health care being provided - can be read from the <a href="/files/pdf/cv.pdf">pieces of paper</a>.</p>
      <p>Now follows a particularly goofy bit of speech that the government compels.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The state of Minnesota has not adopted any educational and training standards for unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioners. this statement of credentials is for information purposes only. Under Minnesota law, an unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioner may not provide a medical diagnosis or recommend discontinuance of medically prescribed treatments. If a client desires a diagnosis from a licensed physician, chiropractor, or acupuncture practitioner, or services from a physician, chiropractor, nurse, osteopathic physician, physical therapist, dietitian, nutritionist, acupuncture practitioner, athletic trainer, or any other type of health care provider, the client may seek such services at any time.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The name of my complementary and alternative health care practice is just my name: R. Floyd Lindquist. There is no physical address associated with my practice. The email address associated with my practice is floydfacts[at]yahoo[dot]com.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The practitioner's fees per unit of service are one million dollars per century. The practitioner's method of billing for such fees is the honor system. The practitioner is not authorized to accept Medicare or medical assistance.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The practitioner is willing to accept partial payment, or to waive payment, if the practitioner believes that the client deserve partial payment or waiver of payment.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client has a right to reasonable notice of changes in services or charges.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The theoretical approach used by the practitioner in providing services to clients is, in essence, various forms of conversation to help the clients deal with the stresses and conflicts of normal life, and especially challenging life - including subjection to a bloated and often lawless government, as well as a collapsing culture infested with so many degenerate frauds and fools</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client has a right to complete and current information concerning the practitioner's assessment and recommended service that is to be provided, including the expected duration of the service to be provided. Clients may expect courteous treatment and to be free from verbal, physical, or sexual abuse by the practitioner. Client records and transactions with the practitioner are confidential, unless release of these records is authorized in writing by the client, or otherwise provided by law. The client has a right to access records and written information from records in accordance with the Minnesota Health Records Act: <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/144.291">Minnesota statutes, sections 144.291 to 144.298</a></p>
      <p class="compelled">Other services may be available in the community. Information concerning the other services is available through the government.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client has the right to choose freely among available practitioners and to change practitioners after services have begun, within the limits of health insurance, medical assistance, or other health programs. The client has a right to coordinated transfer when there will be a change in the provider of services.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client may refuse services or treatment, unless otherwise provided by law,* and the client may assert the client's rights without retaliation.</p>
      <p>*NOTE: the government-mandated section above mentions that some clients many not refuse services. That is a reference to such corrupt government minions as the psychiatrists and psychologists whom the government lets "treat" people, even when the person does not want "treatment." Obviously, then that is not really treatment: obviously, that is a form of legalized, medicalized slavery and torture.</p>

<h3 class="accordion compelled_heading">U.S. Government’s Medical Takeover</h3>
  <div class="panel">
<p>Following is a brief analysis that highlights some of the evil history of the U.S. government's medical takeover. It is a history of tyranny and destruction of paternal authority: a history punctuated by government-run eugenics, mass-mutilation, and mass-murder.</p>
<p>In the late 1800s, U.S. state governments began taking over medicine. Government’s medical takeover started with the U.S. Supreme Court upholding government takeover of medicine in West Virginia.[1] Affirming the West Virginia government’s takeover of medicine, the U.S. Supreme Court invented the following bloated and lawless standard:</p>

<blockquote>The power of the State to provide for the general welfare of its people authorizes it to prescribe all such regulations as in its judgment will secure or tend to secure them against the consequences of ignorance and incapacity, as well as of deception and fraud.[2]</blockquote>

<p>Unsurprisingly, increasingly bloated and lawless governments began leveraging that bloated and lawless Supreme Court invention to create a medical monopoly where the state picks winners and denounces all alternatives as matters of ignorance, deception, and fraud. Eventually, state governments criminalized virtually all <em>unofficial</em> conversations about any medical problems - and defined medical problems as broadly as “sizing up” or “comprehending” <u>any</u> “physical or mental status.”[3]</p>

<h4>Resistance to Government’s Takeover of Medicine</h4>

<p>When government began taking over medicine, countless medical men immediately resisted. This resistance included chiropractors. A few years after the government takeover of medicine, chiropractors started the National School of Chiropractic to protect and advance their style of healthcare. (The school was renamed to the National University Of Health Sciences, in 2000.)Religious medical men also especially resisted government’s takeover of medicine, particularly because government began directing medicine by outlawing various good practices, while allowing and even demanding certain evil practices. A few obvious examples of the evil follow.</p>

<h4>Government Run Eugenics and Mass-mutilation, as well as Forced Vaccination of Vaccine-damaged Individuals</h4>

<p>In 1905, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the Massachusetts government’s penalties against a vaccine-injured priest.[4] Two decades later, evil republican eugenicists on the U.S. Supreme Court (including the Court’s first degenerate Zionist, Louis Brandeis) cited that Massachusetts case when declaring that the men of the Virginia government had the constitutional right to deputize members of its medical monopoly to mutilate a woman’s reproductive order, in order to sterilize her against her will:</p>

<blockquote>“It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”[5]</blockquote>

<h4>Government-run (and Republican-led) Mass-murder Euphmized as Healthcare - and the War Against Fathers' Rights and Duties</h4>

<p>Echoing those evil republican eugenicists, an evil republican degenerate on the Supreme Court wrote the Roe v. Wade (1973) decision, which codified the myth that healthcare includes government conspiring with a deadbeat mom to murder a man’s children. Later, evil Republicans on the Supreme Court - led by the Court’s first degenerate republican feminist, Sandra Day O'Connor - declared that child-murdering conspiracies between government and deadbeat moms were more important than a father’s right to oppose those murderous conspiracies.[6]</p>

<h4>Tyranny and Mass-mutilation in Today's (mostly Bipartisan) Medical-police-state</h4>

<p>About a century after the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the supposed authority of the Massachusetts government to harass and punish a vaccine-injured priest, every federal and state government across the United States leveraged those evil precedents to pretend a justification to criminale going outside, breathing normally, and so forth - during the tyrannical and treasonous medical-martial-law of the covid lockdowns.[7] Now, government's evil medical takeover focuses on, among other things, normalizing chemical and surgical mutilation satanically euphemized as gender affirming care.[8]</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The above analysis describes the political context, modern and historical, where incompetent and corrupt people in government have pretended, and do now pretend, the authority to dictate who can help whom in matters of health. To say the least, the costs - financial <em>and</em> moral  - are immeasurable to enforce this corrupt and degenerate tyranny. Government can have a legitimate role in ensuring honesty and competency by and among medical providers. However, the ongoing government takeover that now repeats generation after generation: it is simply bloated and evil. Indeed, it is a crime against humanity.</p>
