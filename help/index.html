<p>This section of the website links to help that I can offer: resources, warnings, and an archive of previous and upcoming examples of help. (This website is new, and so I have not yet put any of my past helped into the archive, but that is coming up.) First, read the following section about consent.</p>

<h3>Consent</h3>

<p>Good help - ethical and effective help - requires consent: the helped person must agree to the help. True consent requires understanding: the helping person must fully inform the helped person about the benefits, limits, and risks of help. Modern law terms this formula informed consent. Good help requires informed consent. The following sections describe the benefits, limits,and risks of the help that I offer. Below that is the compelled speech that the government requires from complimentary and alternative healthcare providers, such as myself, who choose to help others without getting any licenses from the state.</p>

<h4>Benefits of Help</h4>

<h4>Limits of Help</h4>

<h4>Risks of Help</h4>

<h4>Compelled Speech Required by the Government</h4>
