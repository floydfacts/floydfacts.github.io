  <p>This section of the website links to help that I can offer: advice, resources, warnings, and examples of previous and upcoming help. (This website is new and still under construction.) First, read the following section about consent.</p>
  <h3 class="accordion">Consent</h3>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>Good help is effective <em>and</em> ethical. Ethical help requires <em>consent</em>: the helped person must <em>agree</em> to the help. True consent requires <em>understanding</em>: the helping person must fully inform the helped person about the benefits, limits, and risks of help. Modern law terms this formula <em>informed consent</em>. Good help - ethical help - requires informed consent.</p>
	  <p><strong>Click the following sections to read a description of the benefits, limits, and risks of the help that I offer.</strong></p> <p>Below those descriptions is the compelled speech that the government requires from complimentary and alternative healthcare providers, such as myself, who choose to help others without getting any licenses from the state.</p>
	</div>

  
      <h3 class="accordion">Benefits of My Help</h3>

    <div class="panel">
      <p>At best, my help may help someone to help themselves: to improve his understanding of himself, his family, other people, society, government, the rules of life, and so forth. For more about the kinds of things that I know about for helping, check my <a href="/files/pdf/cv.pdf">pieces of paper.</a></p>
    </div><!--benefits-->
	
      <h3 class="accordion">Limits of My Help</h3>

    <div class="panel">
      <p>Most importantly: nothing that I offer as help can save anyone from themselves. Also, it is illegal for me to claim any title or ability about any of the things that the government has hoarded for itself through licensing.</p>
      <p>So, for example, I have a Master's degree in Nutrition; but, I cannot legally call myself a "nutritionist" - because the government hoards that title for people who jump through several expense and objectively unnecessary steps (for example, never-ending payments to the government, including through the never-ending "continuing education" political scam). Same with public health: I have a Master's degree in public health, focused on epidemiology and nutrition; but, I cannot claim to know anything about how disease works, except in the most abstract and informative - indirect - sense.</p>
      <p>I also have three doctorate degrees: a PsyD (doctorate of psychology), a PhD in Thanatology, and a Doctorate of Law and Policy. Yet, I cannot call myself a "doctor" in the context of any help that I offer as an alternative healthcare provider. I cannot even legally call myself a doctor of law when helping with legal information that I give to people to help reduce their stress about dealing with legal situations. Meanwhile, this issue is a corrupt and politicized mess</p>
      <p>One instructive example is "Dr." Jill Biden. She has a notoriously mediocre doctorate: education. Dr. Jill also has a <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/jill-bidens-doctorate-is-garbage-because-her-dissertation-is-garbage/">notoriously terrible doctoral dissertation</a> that got her gifted that degree. (Still, Jill is not as bad as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-10-11-mn-189-story.html">fraudster and plagiarist  MLK</a>.) Nevertheless, White House propagandists <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbbg8-PokfI">introduced her</a> as "Dr. Jill Biden" - and an "expert" - when propping up Dr. Jill (and fraudster Anthony Fauci) to promote the fake non-vaccine during the covid medical-martial-law tyranny. The government casually lies when calling Jill Biden a doctor. Thus, I will casually telling the truth and call myself a doctor in the context of the various helps that I offer. Nevertheless, the hypocrites in the government illegally forbid me from using the title "doctor":</p>
		
	<p class="quote">"The commissioner [or health] may impose disciplinary action . . .  against any unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioner." Minn. Stat. ยง 146A.08, subd.1(a). "The following conduct is prohibited and is grounds for disciplinary action: . . . Use of the title 'doctor, 'Dr.,' or 'physician' . . . to describe the complementary and alternative health care practices the practitioner provides." <u>Id</u>. (a),(w).</p> 
		
	<p>As punishment for calling oneself "doctor," the law provides for censure, a fine, and more - and the law also includes the illegally vague phrase that the penalty for calling oneself "Dr." or "doctor" may include "<u>any other action</u> justified by the case." <u>Id</u>. ยง 146A.09, subd.1(7) (emphasis added). However, if the government were to try enforcing penalties based on that illegally vague subsection, then the presiding court would be bound, under Supreme Court precedent, to find the law <em>void for vagueness</em>. <u>Cf.</u> United States Congress, Amdt5.8.1 Overview of Void for Vagueness Doctrine (n.d.), <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt5-8-1/ALDE_00013739/">https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt5-8-1/ALDE_00013739</a> ("Criminal statutes that lack sufficient definiteness or specificity are commonly held void for vagueness.") (citing <u>Cantwell v. Connecticut</u>, 310 U.S. 296, 308 (1940)). Meanwhile, as stated above, the law gives the above illegal (and legal) punishing power to the <em>commissioner of health</em>. Minn. Stat. ยง 146A.08, subd.1(a). That is an unelected bureaucrat. <u>See</u> Minn. Dep't of Health, Commissioner Brooke Cunningham (updated 2024, April 3), <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/about/org/eo/cunningham.html">https://www.health.state.mn.us/about/org/eo/cunningham.html</a>. Currently, Minnesota's health commissioner is Brooke Cunningham: some lady who was gifted an affirmative-action medical degree by the sometimes-prestigious and prominent medical program at Duke University (and other medical training by the degenerate child-torturing criminals and fraudsters at Johns Hopkins University) - after earning the immense undergraduate medcial training of a Bachelor's degree in African American studies. <u>See</u> <u>id</u>. It is lazy tyranny and laughable fraud for the government to give statewide dictatorial powers over medicine and health to anyone - especially someone so stunningly mediocre.</p>
		
	<p>The above hypocrisy, criminality, and fraud by the government, in addition to my three earned doctoroate degrees, is why I am totally fine with describing myself as a "doctor" (and a <em>lawyer</em>, and a <em>psychologist</em>, and a <em>thantologist</em>). I will also call myself a nutritionist, and a counselor, and any other basic description for which I reasonably qualify - even though lawless members of our bloated government outlaw those titles for anyone who, again, refuses to jump through countless expensive, unnecessary, and never-ending political hoops. Still, as I describe in the next section on <em>legal risks</em>: getting my help does carry the risk that unelected government bureaucrats may, at any moment and without any good reason, seek to formally outlaw me from helping you - because I call myself "Dr.," like the government calls mediocre fraudster Jill Biden a <em>doctor</em> to prop up her lies about the government's medical martial law, death-shots, suffocation mandates, and so forth.</p>

      <h3 class="accordion">Risks of My Help</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>All help, including mine, has risks. Following are examples of those risks, in four categories of risk: personal, familial, social, legal.</p>
    
		<h4>Personal Risk</h4>
	<p><em>Personal risks</em> may arise by accepting my help. For example, my help may frustrate or stress a given client. Thus, there is the unavoidable and important risk of spending money only to end up feeling worse.</p>
		
		<h4>Familial Risk</h4>
		<p><em>Familial risks</em> may arise by accepting my help. Famous examples of familial risks include where a husband or father receives help, acts on that help - and then is resented. One obvious risk about this is if a husband learns to require authority over his wife, for the first time in his life - and then she ends up resenting that he is no longer so easily manipulated by her. (Of course, while that risk is real, still, the more likely consequence of a husband learning to lead will be that his wife feels relieved.)</p>
				
		<h4>Social Risk</h4>
		<p><em>Social risks</em> may arise by accepting my help. These risks include those describe above in the section on <em>familial risks</em>. Also, guilt by association is massive in our collapsing culture. As you can tell by reading this website, associating with me could highly risk that guilt-by-association.(This is why I leave out the names of my main universities - those from which I earned full degrees - and mention no individual professional relationship. Cancel culture is real - and dangerous.)</p>
					
		<h4>Legal Risk</h4>
		<p><em>Legal risks</em> may arise by accepting my help. For example, someone may act on legal information that I give - good information - and end up in trouble with the law because the person on the other side of the issue is either corrupt, connected, or otherwise, so the law does not apply to them. Also, laws frequently change, so information that is good when I give is - might be outdated by the time someone chooses to use it. This is a key reason that I am careful to couch my legal information as references to government sources that can be verified - initially and later on to check for changes. (State laws on government websites are a good example of this.)</p>
