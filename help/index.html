  <p>This section of the website links to help that I can offer: resources, warnings, and an archive of previous and upcoming examples of help. (This website is new, and so I have not yet put any of my past help into the archive, but that is coming up.) First, read the following section about consent.</p>
  <h3>Consent</h3>
  <p>Good help - that is, ethical and effective help - requires consent: the helped person must agree to the help. True consent requires understanding: the helping person must fully inform the helped person about the benefits, limits, and risks of help. Modern law terms this formula informed consent. Good help requires informed consent. Click the following sections to read a description of the benefits, limits, and risks of the help that I offer. Below those descriptions is the compelled speech that the government requires from complimentary and alternative healthcare providers, such as myself, who choose to help others without getting any licenses from the state.</p>

      <h4>Benefits of Help</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq_answer">
      <p>At best, my help may help someone to help themselves: to improve his understanding of himself, his family, other people, society, government, the rules of life, and so forth.

      <h4>Limits of Help</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq_answer">
      <p>Most importantly: nothing that I offer as help can save anyone from themselves. Also, it is illegal for me to claim any title or ability about any of the things that the government has hoarded for itself through licensing.</p>
      <p>So, for example, I have a Master's degree in Nutrition; but, I cannot legally call myself a "nutritionist" - because the government hoards that title for people who jump through several expense and objectively unnecessary steps (for example, never-ending payments to the government, including through the never-ending "continuing education" political scam). Same with public health: I have a Master's degree in public health, focused on epidemiology and nutrition; but, I cannot claim to know anything about how disease works, except in the most abstract and informative - indirect - sense.</p>
      <p>I also have three doctorate degrees: a PsyD (doctorate of psychology), a PhD in Thanatology, and a Doctorate of Law and Policy. Yet, I cannot call myself a "doctor" in the context of any help that I offer as an alternative healthcare provider. I cannot even legally call myself a doctor of law when helping with legal information that I give to people to help reduce their stress about dealing with legal situations. Meanwhile, this issue is a corrupt and politicized mess</p>
      <p>One instructive example is "Dr." Jill Biden. She has a notoriously mediocre doctorate: education. Dr. Jill also has a <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/jill-bidens-doctorate-is-garbage-because-her-dissertation-is-garbage/">notoriously terrible doctoral dissertation</a> that got her gifted that degree. (Still, Jill is not as bad as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-10-11-mn-189-story.html">fraudster and plagiarist  MLK</a>.) Nevertheless, White House propagandists <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbbg8-PokfI">introduced her</a> as "Dr. Jill Biden" - and an "expert" - when propping up Dr. Jill (and fraudster Anthony Fauci) to promote the fake non-vaccine during the covid medical-martial-law tyranny. This kind of laughable hypocrisy is why, as I describe in the section below on <em>legal risks</em> when getting my help: I actually am totally fine with describing myself as a <em>lawyer</em> (and <em>doctor</em>, etc.), which means someone who has extensively studied law. (Meanwhile, an <em>attorney</em> is nothing but a government title given to some lawyers). I will also call myself a nutritionist, and a counselor, and any other basic description for which I reasonably qualify - regardless that lawless members of our bloated government outlaw those titles for anyone but those who, again, jump through countless expensive, unnecessary, and never-ending hoops.</p>

    <div class="faq_question">
      <h4>Risks of Help</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq_answer">
      <p>All help, include mine, has risks. Following are examples of those risks, in four categories of risk: personal, familial, social, legal.</p>
      <p><em>Personal risks</em> may arise by accepting my help. For example, my help may frustrate or stress a given client. Thus, there is the unavoidable and important risk of spending money only to end up feeling worse.</p>
      <p><em>Familial risks</em> may arise by accepting my help. Famous examples of familial risks include where a husband or father receives help, acts on that help - and then is resented. One obvious risk about this is if a husband learns to require authority over his wife, for the first time in his life - and then she ends up resenting that he is no longer so easily manipulated by her. (Of course, while that risk is real, still, the more likely consequence of a husband learning to lead will be that his wife feels relieved.)</p>
      <p><em>Social risks</em> may arise by accepting my help. These risks include those describe above in the section on <em>familial risks</em>. Also, guilt by association is massive in our collapsing culture. As you can tell by reading this website, associating with me could highly risk that guilt-by-association.(This is why I leave out the names of my main universities - those from which I earned full degrees - and mention no individual professional relationship. Cancel culture is real - and dangerous.)</p>
      <p><em>Legal risks</em> may arise by accepting my help. For example, someone may act on legal information that I give - good information - and end up in trouble with the law because the person on the other side of the issue is either corrupt, connected, or otherwise, so the law does not apply to them. Also, laws frequently change, so information that is good when I give is - might be outdated by the time someone chooses to use it. This is a key reason that I am careful to couch my legal information as references to government sources that can be verified - initially and later on to check for changes. (State laws on government websites are a good example of this.)</p>

      <h4>Compelled Speech Required by the Government</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="faq_answer">
      <p>As president Ronald Reagan's speechwriter famously put it: "The nine most frightening words in the English language are, <em>I'm from the government, and I'm here to help</em>." (Yes: It is eleven words, but the point remains.)</p>
      <p>In an effort to give some of that famous government help, the Minnesota government compels the speech in the following section.</p>
      <h5 class="compelled">Complementary and Alternative Health Care Client Bill Of Rights</h5>
      <p>This section of compelled speech arises under <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/146A.11">Minnesota Statute, section 146A.11.</a></p>
      <p>For the following sections, the "practitioner" is me.</p>
      <p>My name is R. Floyd Lindquist. My complementary and alternative health care title is doctor,* lawyer,* counselor, nutritionist,* psychologist,* thanatologist, teacher, conversationalist - or just Floyd (or Russ).</p>
      <p>*All titles above with a * are illegal to use by anyone whom the government does not license. Meanwhile, I am not licensed to use the title - but use them anyways. For some explanation, go up a few paragraphs to the section on <em>legal risks</em>. Most generally, as to law: I use the titles because the government wildly exceeds its authority under the Constitution by completely outlawing words like "nutritionists" for supposedly non-nutritionists, that is, nutritionists who, like me, decline to pay never-ending penalties to use so basic and descriptive a word as <em>nutritionist</em>. Jurisprudentially, this is a matter of constitutional law arising under the 14th amendment's two-part strict-scrutiny standard: the government must (1) reasonably allege a compelling state interest, <em>and</em> (2) use the least-restrictive-means to acheive that interest. Here, protecting the public from fake doctors, fake nutritionists, and fake lawyers is indeed a compelling state interets; however, banning entire sets of basic and descriptive words is hardly the least restrictive means to acheive such an interest. Instead, under the Constitution, the government may resrict terms like "licensed nutritionist" or "licensed medical doctor" or "licensed attorney" - but not restrict all use of words like nutritionists, doctor, or lawyer. This is my legal advice - as a lawyer.</p>
      <p>A sense of the degrees, training, experience, and other qualifications of the practitioner regarding the complementary and alternative health care being provided - can be read from the <a href="/files/pdf/cv.pdf">pieces of paper</a>.</p>
      <p>Now follows a particularly goofy bit of speech that the government compels:</p>
      <p class="compelled">The state of Minnesota has not adopted any educational and training standards for unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioners. this statement of credentials is for information purposes only. Under Minnesota law, an unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioner may not provide a medical diagnosis or recommend discontinuance of medically prescribed treatments. If a client desires a diagnosis from a licensed physician, chiropractor, or acupuncture practitioner, or services from a physician, chiropractor, nurse, osteopathic physician, physical therapist, dietitian, nutritionist, acupuncture practitioner, athletic trainer, or any other type of health care provider, the client may seek such services at any time.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The name of my complementary and alternative health care practice is just my name: R. Floyd Lindquist. There is no physical address associated with my practice. The email address associated with my practice is floydfacts@yahoo.com.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The practitioner's fees per unit of service are one million dollars per century. The practitioner's method of billing for such fees is the honor system. The practitioner is not authorized to accept Medicare or medical assistance.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The practitioner is willing to accept partial payment, or to waive payment, if the practitioner believes that the client deserve partial payment or waiver of payment.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client has a right to reasonable notice of changes in services or charges.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The theoretical approach used by the practitioner in providing services to clients is, in essence, various forms of conversation to help the clients deal with the stresses and conflicts of normal life, and especially challenging life - including subjection to a bloated and often lawless government, as well as a collapsing culture infested with so many degenerate frauds and fools</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client has a right to complete and current information concerning the practitioner's assessment and recommended service that is to be provided, including the expected duration of the service to be provided. Clients may expect courteous treatment and to be free from verbal, physical, or sexual abuse by the practitioner. Client records and transactions with the practitioner are confidential, unless release of these records is authorized in writing by the client, or otherwise provided by law. The client has a right to access records and written information from records in accordance with the Minnesota Health Records Act: <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/144.291">Minnesota statutes, sections 144.291 to 144.298</a></p>
      <p class="compelled">Other services may be available in the community. Information concerning the other services is available through the government.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client has the right to choose freely among available practitioners and to change practitioners after services have begun, within the limits of health insurance, medical assistance, or other health programs. The client has a right to coordinated transfer when there will be a change in the provider of services.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client may refuse services or treatment, unless otherwise provided by law,* and the client may assert the client's rights without retaliation.</p>
      <p>*NOTE: the government-mandated section above mentions that some clients many not refuse services. That is a reference to such corrupt government minions as the psychiatrists and psychologists whom the government lets "treat" people, even when the person does not want "treatment." Obviously, then that is not really treatment: obviously, that is a form of legalized, medicalized slavery and torture.</p>
