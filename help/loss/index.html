<h3 class="accordion" id="compelled">Speech Compelled by Government</h3>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>As president Ronald Reagan's speechwriter famously put it: "The nine most frightening words in the English language are, <em>I'm from the government, and I'm here to help</em>." (Yes: It is eleven words, but the point remains.)</p>
      <p>In an effort to give some of that famous government help, the Minnesota government compels the speech in the following section.</p>
      <h5 class="compelled">Complementary and Alternative Health Care Client Bill Of Rights</h5>
      <p>This section of compelled speech arises under <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/146A.11">Minnesota Statute, section 146A.11.</a> For the following sections, the "practitioner" is me.</p>
      <p>My name is R. Floyd Lindquist. My complementary and alternative health care title is doctor,* lawyer,* counselor, nutritionist,* psychologist,* thanatologist, teacher, conversationalist - or just Floyd (or Russ).</p>
      <p>All titles above with a * are illegal to use by anyone whom the government does not license. Meanwhile, I am not licensed to use the titles, but I use them anyways. For some explanation, go up to the section <em>limits of help</em>. Most generally, as to law: I use the titles because the government wildly exceeds its authority under the Constitution by completely outlawing words like "nutritionist" for supposedly non-nutritionists: people who, like me, are nutritionists by training - but decline to pay never-ending penalties (license fees, continuing education requirements, etc.) to use so basic and descriptive a word as <em>nutritionist</em>.</p> 
		
	  <p>Jurisprudentially, this is a matter of constitutional law arising under the 14th amendment's two-part strict-scrutiny standard: the government must (1) reasonably allege a compelling state interest, <em>and</em> (2) use the least-restrictive-means to acheive that interest. Here, protecting the public from fake doctors, fake nutritionists, and fake lawyers is indeed a compelling state interets; however, banning entire sets of basic and descriptive words is hardly the least restrictive means to acheive such an interest. Instead, under the Constitution, the government may resrict terms like "licensed nutritionist" or "licensed medical doctor" or "licensed attorney" - but not restrict all use of words like nutritionists, doctor, or lawyer. This is my legal advice - as a lawyer.</p>
      <p>A sense of the degrees, training, experience, and other qualifications of the practitioner regarding the complementary and alternative health care being provided - can be read from the <a href="/files/pdf/cv.pdf">pieces of paper</a>.</p>
      <p>Now follows a particularly goofy bit of speech that the government compels.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The state of Minnesota has not adopted any educational and training standards for unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioners. this statement of credentials is for information purposes only. Under Minnesota law, an unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioner may not provide a medical diagnosis or recommend discontinuance of medically prescribed treatments. If a client desires a diagnosis from a licensed physician, chiropractor, or acupuncture practitioner, or services from a physician, chiropractor, nurse, osteopathic physician, physical therapist, dietitian, nutritionist, acupuncture practitioner, athletic trainer, or any other type of health care provider, the client may seek such services at any time.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The name of my complementary and alternative health care practice is just my name: R. Floyd Lindquist. There is no physical address associated with my practice. The email address associated with my practice is floydfacts[at]yahoo[dot]com.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The practitioner's fees per unit of service are one million dollars per century. The practitioner's method of billing for such fees is the honor system. The practitioner is not authorized to accept Medicare or medical assistance.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The practitioner is willing to accept partial payment, or to waive payment, if the practitioner believes that the client deserve partial payment or waiver of payment.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client has a right to reasonable notice of changes in services or charges.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The theoretical approach used by the practitioner in providing services to clients is, in essence, various forms of conversation to help the clients deal with the stresses and conflicts of normal life, and especially challenging life - including subjection to a bloated and often lawless government, as well as a collapsing culture infested with so many degenerate frauds and fools</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client has a right to complete and current information concerning the practitioner's assessment and recommended service that is to be provided, including the expected duration of the service to be provided. Clients may expect courteous treatment and to be free from verbal, physical, or sexual abuse by the practitioner. Client records and transactions with the practitioner are confidential, unless release of these records is authorized in writing by the client, or otherwise provided by law. The client has a right to access records and written information from records in accordance with the Minnesota Health Records Act: <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/144.291">Minnesota statutes, sections 144.291 to 144.298</a></p>
      <p class="compelled">Other services may be available in the community. Information concerning the other services is available through the government.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client has the right to choose freely among available practitioners and to change practitioners after services have begun, within the limits of health insurance, medical assistance, or other health programs. The client has a right to coordinated transfer when there will be a change in the provider of services.</p>
      <p class="compelled">The client may refuse services or treatment, unless otherwise provided by law,* and the client may assert the client's rights without retaliation.</p>
      <p>*NOTE: the government-mandated section above mentions that some clients many not refuse services. That is a reference to such corrupt government minions as the psychiatrists and psychologists whom the government lets "treat" people, even when the person does not want "treatment." Obviously, then that is not really treatment: obviously, that is a form of legalized, medicalized slavery and torture.</p>
