  <div class="panel">
<p>In the late 1800s, U.S. state governments began taking over medicine. Government’s medical takeover started with the U.S. Supreme Court upholding government takeover of medicine in West Virginia. Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114 (1889). Affirming the West Virginia government’s takeover of medicine, the U.S. Supreme Court invented the following bloated and lawless standard:</p>

<p>“The power of the State to provide for the general welfare of its people authorizes it to prescribe all such regulations as in its judgment will secure or tend to secure them against the consequences of ignorance and incapacity, as well as of deception and fraud.” Dent at 122.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, increasingly bloated and lawless governments began leveraging that bloated and lawless Supreme Court invention to create a medical monopoly where the state picks winners and denounces all alternatives as matters of ignorance, deception, and fraud. Eventually, state governments criminalized virtually all conversations about any medical problems - and defined medical problems as broadly as “sizing up” or “comprehending” any “physical or mental status.” People v. Amber, 76 Misc. 2d 267, 268, 349 N.Y.S.2d 604 (NY 1973).</p>

<h4>Resistance to Government’s Takeover of Medicine</h4>

<p>When government began taking over medicine, countless medical men resisted. This resistance included chiropractors. A few years after the government takeover of medicine, chiropractors started National School of Chiropractic to protect and advance their style of healthcare. (The school was renamed to the National University Of Health Sciences, in 2000). Religious medical men also especially resisted government’s takeover of medicine, particularly because government began directing medicine by outlawing various good practices, while allowing and even demanding certain evil practices. A few obvious examples of the evil follow.</p>

<p>In 1905, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the Massachusetts government’s penalties against a vaccine-injured priest. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905). Two decades later, evil repulican eugenicists on the U.S. Supreme Court (including the Court’s first degenerate zionist) cited that Massachusetts case when declaring that the men of the Virigina government had the constitutional right to deputize members of its medical monopoly to mutilate a woman’s reproductive order, in order to sterilize her against her will:</p>

<p>“It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.” Buck v. Bell 274 U.S. 200, 207 (1927).</p>

<p>Echoing those evil republican eugenicists, an evil republican degenerate on the Supreme Court wrote the Roe v. Wade (1973) decision, which codified the myth that healthcare includes government conspiring with a deadbeat mom to murder a man’s children. Later, evil Republicans on the Supreme Court - led by the Court’s first degenerate republican feminist, Sandra Day O'Connor - declared that child-murdering conspiracies between government and deadbeat moms were more important than a father’s right to oppose those murderous conspiracies. Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992).</p>

<p>About a century after the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the supposed authority of the Massachusetts government to harass and punish a vaccine-injured priest, governments across the United States, including the federal government, leveraged those evil precedents to pretend a justification for criminalizing going outside, breathing normally, and so forth - during the tyrannical and treasonous medical-martial-law of the covid lockdowns.

<p>This is the political context, modern and historical, where the government pretends the authority to dictate who can help whom in matters of health.</p>
