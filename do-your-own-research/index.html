<h2>"Do your own research": Limits and Risks</h2>

  <p>Nowadays, a popular phrase is, "Do your own research," often accompanied by, "Don't take anyone's word, not even mine." Sometimes, "Do your own research," is good advice. Sometimes, it's bad advice. Some people mean well when they say it. Yet, others say it ironically to flatter you into the temptation of taking their word for something. A third kind say it because they know or suspect that their ideological teammates have monopolized the issue, so you may never hear a perspective alternative to theirs if you "do your own research." In any case, be careful when presuming an ability to do your own research about an issue. Maybe you can; maybe you cannot. Maybe you are just a few tips away from being able to do your own research. Yet, perhaps without those few tips, doing your own research would be terribly inefficient or misleading - even dangerous or deadly.</p> 

<h3><u>Do Not</u> Blindly "Trust the Experts" - Including Yourself</h3>

<p>If you have ever talked to me in person, you will almost certainly know that I am the last person to insist that people must blindly "trust the experts." However, with that comes the fact that I include the person, themselves, as among those real and imagined experts: do not blindly believe in your own ability to understand an issue without help.</p>

<p>Some believe that <em>in a perfect world</em> everyone could and would just "do their own research." They are mistaken: that world is neither perfect nor even possible. Rather, we are meant to socialize and learn from each other. Always be ready to do your own research - yet always be ready also to humbly admit when you may need help. </p>
